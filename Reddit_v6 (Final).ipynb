    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit claims to be the front page of the internet, and that's because they are.  With an average of 542 million monthly visitors, of which 234 million are unique, Reddit is the third most visited site in the U.S. and ranked sixth in the world.  Reddit is subdivided into subreddits, which are themed discussion boards created and populated by Reddit users with links, text, videos and images.  These subreddits span an ostensibly endless array of interests including world news, sports, economics, movies, music, fitness, and really anything that anyone has ever thought about and wants to talk about.  Reddit members discuss proposed topics in the comments section, and the most popular comments are \"up-voted\" to the top of the discussion board an possibly even on the site's landing page.  In 2015, Reddit users submitted nearly 75 million posts and followed up with nearly three quarters of a billion comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, Reddit is one of the most incredible internet platforms available to date.  Not only is it technologically accessible to anyone with an internet connection, but it is also philosophically accesible in that all people from all walks of life are free to engage in conversation with anyone else in the subreddit of their choosing (provided they follow Reddit's harrassment policies.) But with so many users, submissions, comments, and up-votes, it can also seem impossible to craft a post that will ever see the light of day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But viral posts are not flukes.  In fact, they usually hue closely to established patterns and trends.  Once the trends are uncovered, anyone can write a popular post that will likely appeal to a wide audience and gain traction within the targeted discussion board. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using data science techniques like exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and natural language processing allows us to effiently search through thousands (and millions, if the project calls for it) data points to identify what matters and what doesn't - in other words, what sinks an article and what makes it swim.  Specifically, when analyzing text within titles, posts, and comments, we can vectorize words to identify which ones are more frequently used, and therefore appropriated.  Themes rise from posts when aggregating text in word clouds.  Comments can be analyzed for sentiment using prepackaged libraries to identify how users are engaging with the content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With an endless supply of things to read on the internet, it seems impossible to write a post that anyone else but your mom will read.  Data science undeniably refutes this assumption.  Rather, with a few (hundred) keystrokes, a platform as wild as Reddit can be neatly distilled into a handful of targeted insights.\n",

      "I'll return.\n",
      "Ugh I'm so frustrated. I thought we were doing a good thing for ourselves but now I think we are trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full backstory: A friend recommended their \"financial advisor\" to us. We thought \"Great! We've been meaning to meet with someone... we have a kid on the way and husband isn't putting away anything towards retirement since starting his new job in August\". \n",
      "\n",
      "So we set up phone meeting with his friend from Northwestern Mutual. She gives us a call, and we end up speaking with her for over an hour. She asks us lots of questions- what we are looking for (we tell her we want to set up retirement stuff for husband and explore maybe putting some of our 17k in savings into CD's or mutual funds). She asks us questions about when we see ourselves retiring, how \"aggressive\" we are, etc. All good stuff. We hang up and agree to talk again in a week when she will give us a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut to a week later, we are having a phone meeting with her and she emails me THE PLAN. It's many many pages basically explaining what we have vs. what we will need if we want to retire.  But she mostly just talks about how we need more life insurance. \"Sure\" we think. Maybe we do need more life insurance. She explains that husband needs at least $1mill in life insurance and I need $500k (we both already have $150k policies through work on ourselves). This is news to us but we hear her out. She also spends a ton of time explaining how we need to have disability insurance. Again, we think \"maybe we do\". So we spend the greater part of an hour and a half talking about life insurance and long term disability insurance. She briefly mentions we should be maxing out my Roth IRA and we could perhaps start one for husband. So we hang up, with plans to talk again in a week and sign some paperwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next week, husband and I really realize that we don't want disability insurance (she quoted us paying like $170/month) and we didn't really feel we needed more life insurance at this time (she had us paying $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term). But we were ok maxing out my Roth at $450/month. We also wanted to explore stocks/bonds/CD's/mutual funds more (like we initially told her). So I sent this all to her in an email before our next meeting. She sends back \"OK, great! Sounds good.. talk soon\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut to another phone meeting, where she would talk with us about our updated PLAN. She emails us the NEW PLAN while we are on the phone. LITERALLY NOTHING IS CHANGED. She proceeds to spend the next hour convincing us why we need life insurance and disability insurance. Husband and I are both pushovers and listen to the whole schpeel again. Every time we bring up a reason why we don't feel like we need it, she tells us how we are wrong. I mean, she's the professional, we thought. I still expressed my disinterest in disability insurance but wasn't completely closing the door on life insurance. She kept giving me the guilt trip on \"what will your kids have if one of you dies!\". By the end of the conversation, I hadn't agreed to anything except to roll over my Roth to Northwestern. She had me give her my bank routing info to get \"the paperwork started\". She also said she was going to be sending me a bunch of stuff to sign in the next few weeks, but it was just to apply for things... nothing was set in stone. We could just see what the insurance company was going to quote us at, and we still aren't committed to anything. \"Ugh fine\" I think. She says a small amount might be taken out of my checking, but its just to make sure \"the charges are able to go through when we start moving more money to my Roth\".\n",
      "\n",
      "SO a week or two goes by. And I see a ~$30 charge go through for \"disability insurance\". WHICH I TOLD HER I DIDN'T WANT!! And I just realize... this doesn't feel good. It doesn't seem right. She's not listening to what we want. She still hasn't addressed out interest in CD/mutual funds/stocks that we initially came to her for. I spend the weekend doing my due diligence- spending a few hours on r/personalfinance, NerdWallet, just googling in general about what husband and I should really be doing. I decide to call the whole thing off with Northwestern.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been a nightmare trying to cut off ties with her. I was kind and courteous through the first couple emails and subsequent texts \"We really appreciate your time but have decided to pull out. Again, thank you\". \n",
      "\n",
      "She is being evasive and manipulative. Telling us we are completely wrong and we still need to work with her. At this point I have just ignored any further communication. It has just been a really bad experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But THE REAL REASON I still feel like I can't completely ignore her, is that I asked her several times when I should expect to see a refund for the disability insurance THAT I DID NOT WANT AND DID NOT AGREE TO. She just dances around the question. I'm also worried because I have gotten a \"bill\" (no charges yet) in the mail for the $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term and $170 in short term disability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything I can do to make sure I don't get charged this? If I communicate with her any farther, she just tries to talk to us about why we need to invest with her, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT DO WE DO. She is being shady AF.  \n",
      "I’ll preface this by saying I’m from the UK. I recently visited the US and what shocked me most wasn’t the enormous size and low price of the fast food, nor was it rampant drug abuse almost everywhere we went.\n",
      "\n",

      "This all happened five or so years ago while I was working for a proprietary trading firm. The company is a multinational and it had opened a new office in my city a couple of years before I joined them. For those who don't know, most prop shops (as I understood it) have a very high turnover rate. Just toss everyone in and keep those who stick. The company I worked for recruited every three months. It had space for about 120 traders but the office was never full. Out of the twenty or so who were hired every quarter, only about five managed to make it beyond the three month internship period, and of those, only one - or sometimes none at all - made it past the additional three months probation period. The company was operating in my city for two years before I joined and there were only about four people who I could have called permanent. Everyone else, about another ten, was either on their internship or on probation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "I and about twenty five others were recruited straight out of university. The internship period paid really well for a first job, about twice as much as any other entry level position in other financial institutions plus bonuses once we went live (regardless of whether one is on internship, probation or permanent), and I was really excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "I first came across my boss, a really decent Indian guy, at a industry day held in our university. That was where they administered the IQ tests and I passed. The office, similar to other mid-sized operations, had a pretty flat management structure. Us traders were at the lowest level, the HR/Ops manager was above us, and the Office Manager was, well, the head of the branch. The boss gave time off pretty much whenever you asked for it as long as the day's objectives were fulfilled (that was his policy).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the HR/Ops manager was his opposite, and then some. This lady was a Grade-A bitch, and I mean that sincerely. Let's call her Gabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Instigating Event\n",
      "\n",
      "I first met Gabby when I went to their offices for my final interview. I was registering at the front desk when she marched from her office demanding some documents from the receptionist. The receptionist wanted to finish up with me first but she was ordered off to file storage. Our exchange went like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabby: You're one of the new ones?\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Yes. I'm really excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabby: Don't be. you don't look like you'll make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Why?\n",

      "Gabby: You're too soft.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabby: Buut... I can put in a good word for you, if you give me a little something. ( a bribe).\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: Haha. Very funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabby: I'm serious. Give something and I'll make it very easy for you. Otherwise I'll make sure you don't even get into the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabby: Stupid idiot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right to my face. And she kept her word. She made me sit in a hidden corner of the waiting room where no one would see me easily, but I could hear the conversations at the desk. The only reason why I got an interview is because apparently I had impressed the boss at our previous meeting that he came to see why my CV wasn't there. Gabby said that I hadn't sent it in. The receptionist stated that she had seen it somewhere. Then I walked up to the desk at the same time the receptionist said, \"Here it is. It was in the trash...\" and everyone stared at Gabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment of humiliation onwards, Gabby had a raging hate boner for me. You see, Gabby was a micromanager, more of a nanomanager really. She made us have to request access if we wanted to access sites other than those on her approved list, and for traders who gain info from wherever we could find it, her list was woefully inadequate. She would call meetings at the most inopportune times - but only when the branch manager was not around - and in her lengthy meetings, you could never leave to check on your positions. She had this annoying habit of taking my lunch and when I confronted her about it, she essentially told me to go fuck myself. That I could live with. I just started bringing in two sets of lunch and kept on doing the job that I loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gabby was married with two kids, and she was pretty. I guess she liked the attention because she would have a stream of guys picking her up at the office for two hour 'lunches' and when she left for home some evening. But not on Thursday. Thursdays were the days when her husband would come pick her up towing their kids along. I think they went to have a family dinner or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mistakes Gabby Made: Round One\n",
      "\n",
      "Our manager left about two months after I joined. I think he returned to India to get married or something but still stayed with the company. Wished him all the best. None of the other permanent traders had the experience corporate required to take on a management role (5 years at least) so they had to shop around. In the meantime, Gabby became the de-facto head of the branch despite the fact that her knowledge of futures markets was rudimentary at best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first mistake was when she delayed my promotion from internship to probation. I am an excellent trader, and was easily top five in my group. Of the 26, she promoted the twenty she liked, kept me and another guy in internship, and fired four.At around the same time, another recruitment drive happened and another twentyish interns were hired. I knew this was our beef rekindled and remixed, and I was actually surprised she held onto it for so long. It was also pretty unusual since the last thing my former boss did before he left was to promote me from the simulator to a live trading account. But I kept my head down and continued learning, often going back to my former boss and the permanent employees to get advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another three months go by, and in the next evaluation I was shocked that I was still not brought up to probation, despite the fact that all of the new recruits of the second group had been promoted and I was easily the best and the only one trading live. I knew I was good at the job. The permanent guys all said so. The group I initially joined with was frequently asking me for advice. To their credit, a few of them were good, but most of them were still on sim, and as a rule, no one advanced to probation while still on sim. However, you could go live while on internship if you were good which is what had happened to me. So I was a live trader and making good money but I was still on internship and passed over twice. I couldn't let go of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to talk to Gabby directly. I approached the senior guys and made my case, though I was careful not to put her in bad light. They agreed to help me and so they did. about a month after the she passed me over the second time, she gave me my promotion and I was now on probation. At this time, she was still unsure of her power and was still afraid of the permanent traders. Those guys were like gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two months after my promotion, another evaluation and recruitment drive. I was not promoted. The group I started out with was now permanent, despite having only two of them trading live. The group I was currently with on probation were all promoted to permanent status. The group behind me on internship was all promoted to probation, and another group was hired. I let it go hoping she had got it out of her system. Sadly, she had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round Two\n",
      "\n",
      "Three months go by. I'm trading live and loving it, though still on probation. An evaluation comes up again and I'm not promoted, despite the fact that, contract to contract, I was almost on a level with the permanent employees. The group that found me on probation was advanced to permanent status to a man, and none of them were live. the group behind me caught up to me and a new batch of newbies were hired as interns. I couldn't let this one go either. I approached the original four permanent employees who were now my very good buddies and planned to do the same thing as last time. Only this time, it didn't work. Gabby had grown into her sadistic power and flatly refused to even consider my promotion even after she was presented with evidence that I was worth it. Her argument was along the lines of, \"I'm the boss so I can do whatever the hell I want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But I wasn't having that, so I contacted my former boss for help. At the time he had been promoted to head of operations, Africa. He was actually quite surprised, given my performance, that I was still on probation. Needless to say, the order came down from on high and Gabby looked like she was shitting six pineapples simultaneously as she handed my letter. And I thought that was the end of it. How wrong I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the next recruitment she hired this girl, let's call her Sue. Sue was an intelligent person all round, but she didn't have the emotional quotient to handle the market (trading, as I was taught, requires two mental aspects: IQ and EQ. You can't improve IQ, but you can boost your EQ to deal with the numerous stresses that accompany the career). Sue had more than enough of the IQ part, but EQ, not so much. No worries, you can work on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to recap: The office now had about seventy employees. Of these, over thirty were permanent staff (me included) but only eleven were trading live. Another twenty or so were on probation, but only three were trading live. None of the interns were live. The office needed to stay profitable if it was to stay open which means that the money the fourteen live traders were paying the salaries of everyone in the office, rent, supplies, health insurance, pensions etc etc. Needless to say, corporate was not seeing a lot of returns from our branch, and as I came to learn later from my former boss, were considering shutting down the branch and costing us our jobs. But I digress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Last Straw\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grade-A Bitch Gabby took advantage of an inconsolable and desperate Sue to try and get me for sexual harassment. This is how it went down. Remember all those people still on sim? Well, they all came to the eleven of us for trading advice and we did what we could to help them. We divided up the sim traders into groups and I was mentoring about four people. Sue was one of them. As any trader will tell you, the period before profitability is usually one of losses (unless you're really good) and is filled with stress and fear (hence the need for high EQ). It's normal, and you get through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sue was going through such a rough patch one evening. We were going over her trades (bad trading day all around), when she just burst out crying. I know how it feels. I had shed my own tears as well. So comforted her the best I could. I held her hand and patted her on the back awkwardly (to this day I still don't know how to comfort someone) until she quieted down. What I didnt know was that Gabby had seen us.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I came to learn later, she approached Sue the following day and made her an offer. Gabby would make sure Sue kept her job and would get her a lot of money if she stated that I had sexually harassed her. Sue took Gabby up on the offer and what followed was a nightmare.It started with a formal reprimand from corporate, a hearing in which I wasn't present to defend myself (because Gabby 'forgot' to send me the summons).\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently she lobbied quite viciously to get me fired. The only reason I was able to keep my job was that my former boss came to my defence. Despite his help, I lost my quarterly bonus (about US$100,000) and half of my holdback (about US$400,000). I also had to attend seminars which essentially involved watching the same film on sexual assault in the workplace (three hours long) until I stated, in writing, that I was an abuser and it would go on my record. I knew that if that happened, Gabby would have the ammunition she needed to ruin my life forever. So every day, I got into the office at seven in the morning, watched the three hour film until ten. Refuse to acknowledge it, then get to work, leave the office at 11:20 in the evening, rinse and repeat. For almost seven months. It was tiring, and torture, and Gabby never let me live it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the people I had been mentoring were transferred the day after my reprimand. A day after that, Gabby informed me via letter that my clip size had been cut from 1000 to 20 contracts. Yeah, I had to admit, I was bloodied. I was down, but the bitch didn't know that she should have ended me.\n",

      "I started compiling all the shit that was happening to me in the office. It started when I realized that when I went out to lunch, someone would open my desk drawer and mess around with my notebook, where I jotted down my trading ideas for the day. The only person who had a key apart from me was Gabby. Apparently she had mastered my lunchtime routine for the entire 45 minute break and would open my locker when I was out smoking. She would then copy down my trading plans for the day and give them to Sue. I even saw them at it once, but they didn't see me. I documented it. I let it go on for a while so that I could establish a pattern via Sue's trades. I then approached two of the permanent traders who were closest to me and told them my plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember when I said almost no money was reaching corporate? and that there were only eleven live traders? The situation had only gotten worse. The office was now full but we had less that fifteen live traders. Live trading could only be approved by Head of Operations (my former boss) and he was a strict one. Now imagine that my earning capacity had been cut by over 90%. My two friends agreed to my plan and they slowed down their trading by around 50%. This essentially put the branch in the red and three weeks later, we were told that Head of Ops and other head honchos were coming down. The next phase involved getting Sue into a corner. Pleas, a tear or two, and revealing that I could prove she had been stealing my work were enough to get a written statement from her that Gabby had orchestrated my whole sexual harassment thing.\n",

      "It took only a little investigation on my part to realize than all those men who visited the office were actually Gabby's lovers. She would leave for two-hour 'lunches' with her phone turned off. I took advantage of one such period. Gabby left and I snuck into her office to find her Facebook profile open. Everyone knew she was always on there and it was a sore point because she had banned it for the rest of us minions. I got into her Messenger, and voila! Explicit texts, nudes, rants about her husband and his inadequacies, the six guys or so she had cheated with, all of it. I copy pasted the data into her private email which she was logged into as well (always clear cache, you guys) and sent it to my private email, then deleted it from her sent folder. Now I had the ammo on my phone ready to send.\n",

      "I was at the office at seven as usual with all my documentation from my appointment letter to the numerous rejected requests for promotion, sat through the three hour sexual harassment video (yes, I was still doing that), and waited for the Moment. The guys from corporate, my former boss included, arrived and went straight into a meeting with Gabby. I was quite certain that they would call me in to know why I had been attending a sexual harassment awareness class for almost a year, and I was ready for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was called in after lunch, at about two. The question was asked and before I could answer, Gabby jumped on the bit like I knew she would. She went on a long rant about how I had been insubordinate, and how I liked to touch the female employees. I could tell from her grin that she thought she was winning.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I pulled out Sue's letter, and the grin curdled on her face. Sue was hurriedly called in and she backed my story. She said she was sorry. She was fired on the spot and told to go wait at the receptionist for her final check. I felt no sympathy. I was on a roll.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next I pulled out my analysis of my trades and told them how Gabby had been breaking into my locker and stealing my notes for sue. Gabby denied it. Sue was called back in. She denied it. My former boss logged into the company network, pulled Sue's and my trading data. He compared the positions taken by both of us with my notes. He said it was true. Sue was fired again. They told me they would refund my confiscated bonus and holdback, with an extra 50 grand. That was fine by me. The justice was enough.\n",

He finally left with their kids in tow (sorry little ones) Gabby followed him still shouting at him. Then she saw us all standing around and the look on her face was priceless as she was wondering which aspect of her life to try and salvage. She let her husband go, but about an hour later she had been fired.\n",

      "My favorite boss stayed behind since there was no one left. He stayed for a month training the lady who had been with the company the longest to take over as manager. She is easily the most brilliant mind I had ever met. Unfortunately the branch was still struggling with so many employees who were not generating income and they had to shut it down. But they transferred all the performing employees to their other various branches in London (2 branches) and India (9 branches). So I guess no one undeservedly lost their jobs.\n",

      "I still stalk Gabby on Facebook. There have been a lot of \"I'm single because I'm too awesome\" posts of late.

A week goes on and she is still in severe pain so I booked her an appointment at an orthopedic specialist.  Her first appointment she waited 2 hours and got an xray that he looked at for ~1 minute before telling her there was nothing wrong and just to take 'epsom salt baths' for her foot which was pretty bruised.  A week later she went for a followup with him and again she waited for 2 hours for him to see her for ~2 minutes and he said everything was looking better and she should be fine to get back to hiking.\n",

Now I’m not the fastest smoker of a cigarette in the world and indeed on this occasion I felt no pressure to hurry but even so on my return seeing the same message did crush my dreams and hopes of an early finish for the weekend. I sat down in front of the screen again and hoped, even prayed for a new message or some kind a computer action. My dreams were met shortly afterwards when said PC came up with the reboot message. Enlivened by this I sat up straight expecting to dive back into work with gusto. Unfortunately I received a virtual kick in the nether regions from my black boxed nemesis as it gave me an all too familiar message “we couldn’t complete the updates\\- Undoing changes” My life swam around me, memories of the past came flooding back as I relived my time on this earth, the good, the bad, the ugly in a kaleidoscope of images, I summoned my last will of hope and strained every sinew in my body and started to bang my head against the keyboard again and again and again and… well you get the picture. Eventually as we all know, hope springs eternal and some 45 minutes after 1st attempting to do my duty the sign on screen finally appeared, with some trepidation I entered the password and after a further 5 minutes knobs, buttons keys and the mouse sprang into life.

Where to get any leftovers for those nights when your stomach won’t stop growling, the best hook\\-up spots, where my friends and I hide the only deck of cards with ALL 52 cards. Our station head, President Anton Fowler, keeps things fairly strict. Punishable crimes mostly come from trying to pull a fast one over the authorities here. The only thing that would be punishable from my list above is stealing food. I’ve been sent to a week of solitude for stealing leftover stale bread one night when all they served for dinner was wrinkly beans and inedible hard, green bananas. At the time, our station farm wasn’t producing enough food at the rate it was supposed to. I shouldn’t complain about that though. Last year’s fall was the toughest. Weak harvest and at least 20 more births per month than they expected. I guess scientific population projections aren’t always consistent when there’s not much more to do than have sex on this station. I heard the Chinese stations have 10 more basketball courts than us, a swimming pool, and music rooms. Who knows if that’s true. Maybe if we had more basketball courts people would stop having babies. Seems legit.\n",

But I was looking for a poetry book my hook\\-up buddy, Jack, suggested I read. He’s one of those literary types: glasses, messy hair, always lost in thought. I knew that if I wanted to keep him somewhat interested in me I had to show some interest in this hipster shit. I’m not really into emotions or poetry, but whatever. Girls gotta get laid.\n",

      "She rolled her eyes. “Whatever dude, I’m old school and guys love a girl who uses *vintage* terms and knows who Kendrick Lamar is.  Speaking of dudes.. I wonder who suggested THAT book to you.” She pointed at ‘Leaves of Grass’ in my grasp. We began walking toward the exit of the library.\n",

No one goes abroad to other stations except the President and other higher level employees every so often.\n",

I’ve got to catch up on some of this shit myself,” she wiggled her book in the air. “My boss asked me if I had read the latest edition, the one the Russians on Station 2 corrected. Damn Russians, they’re supposed to make my job easier, not harder.” Celeste worked in the technology department. I’m not even entirely sure what her job is there, but yeah, she’s smart,\n",

But man, Walt Whitman could write, and by that, I mean he could write a lot. This book was fucking long.

At this point I knew the stadium would be fairly full, so I went straight to the upper levels.\n",

He has his shit together. I do not.\n",

      "I was close to the exit so I made it out of the stadium in about 20 seconds. Across the hall outside of the stadium was one of my childhood hiding spots.

We used jackets to lay on the ground in the corridors and waited to see what sacrifice the 40&amp;#37; will be asked to make, still hoping and praying that this was all an experiment. A test of some kind that will end shortly.\n",

We will honor you for your contribution to our future. Our station has been slowly overpopulating for the last 4 decades. We hoped that the population would even out naturally, however the birth rate was increasing steadily. Because of this, we have devised this plan. A plan where 40&amp;#37; of you will give up your lives for others to live theirs. Those of you who are weaker, slower, smaller, potentially older and those who could not make it out of the stadium in the allotted time will be sent to the beyond. You are just as lucky as the 60&amp;#37; who will live, just as lucky as them to die for Station 11.”\n",

      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We introduced some back-end changes to prepare for an upcoming feature and in some cases, the game would try to interact with this unfinished feature, causing the game to crash.\n",
      " \n",
      "2. A crash is occurring in relation to caching memory, which is used to improve performance. We’ve been actively addressing this issue since December, steadily reducing the instances of crashes related to this each patch. We are focusing on resolving this problem entirely by the end of June.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "As players have noticed, crashes and lag happen more often in highly populated areas.To combat this, on top of our standard ongoing performance and stability work, we recently introduced a system designed specifically to improve performance and reduce crashes in highly populated areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously, we handled character resources in full for everyone that was near the player, within a 1km radius. This was causing lag/FPS drops and crashes at the early stages of the game after landing, as too many resources were being handled all at once, in populated areas. We have been working on introducing a dynamic system for these specific situations and have implemented a system called “Elastic Accuracy Control for Character, or EACC. Each resource was refreshed at a constant rate within 1km radius of your player. When characters were picking up items, changing clothes etc, this was causing all items within the 1km radius to be refreshed.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "We made this system dynamic with EACC. It will now work depending on many factors, mainly distance. It will handle resources (refresh resources faster or slower) depending on those factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like PBLS, with each patch, EACC will become more effective at improving performance and in turn reducing crashes, as we gather more data each patch cycle and our engineers implement improvements based on the analysis of that data.\n",

      "\n",
      "**World Rendering (Loading)**\n",
      "\n",
      "The rendering (loading) process is different in each match, for each player, in each location. We need to find the best process to load resources in all scenarios, for every player. As mentioned in our previous dev letter, we’re using a system called prediction-based level streaming (PBLS) to speed up the rendering process. Our engineers are adjusting and optimizing this system every patch, based on data accumulated during that patch cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "PBLS is used specifically when parachuting, as it uses a lot of resources which can cause lower FPS for players. We use a different non-prediction-based level streaming system while on the ground, as it is more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "When parachuting and falling through the air, a lot more resources have to be loaded than when you’re moving in on the ground. Imagine a chessboard as our map, with each square representing a square on our map. Your character occupies a square on that chessboard while on the ground and the game will load three squares in front of you (in a T shape), as your movement is somewhat predictable—we know where you’re going.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "This is much different when in the air, parachuting. When you’re parachuting and falling towards the ground, everything around you has to be loaded, because we can’t predict where you will go. Instead of having to only load three squares in front of you, an area of 3x3 squares around you will have to be loaded. With PBLS, this system intuitively decides where in that 3x3 area to load first, to improve rendering times in the area where you’re going to land.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "As you all know, there are often problems with rendering happening too slowly when driving vehicles, where buildings can suddenly appear in front of you, or you can get stuck inside a building which didn’t appear to be there previously. We have a level streaming system (separate from our prediction-based system) which is used while on the ground specifically, this system will load resources that you’re heading towards and instantly dump resources far behind you to improve performance. When travelling at high speeds, rendering can often not happen quickly enough, and we’re working to improve this system.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll be making adjustments to level-streaming, further taking into account vehicle speed to improve the process of rendering resources you want to see and dumping those that are no longer needed.\n",

      "&amp;nbsp;\n",

      "**Server Performance**\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of each match, the server is under the most stress due to having to keep track of 100 players all at once. We’ve recently applied some network improvements to the PC servers to help alleviate some early game load and we’re working to push these optimizations to Xbox as soon as possible, once they’re proven to be stable.\n",

      "If you asked the average American how they feel about participating in the national anthem, I think your average person would say that they couldn't be bothered by it. All you do is stand when they ask you stand, take off your hat, place your hand over your heart, face the flag, and to keep doing it for another minute and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? What exactly does our national anthem symbolize? \"Well it symbolizes freedom,\" some say. At the same time others will tell you that by participating in the anthem you are paying tribute to our troops, or to those who lost their lives defending our flag and its values. Some will say it's a culmination of the two and then a couple other things. And then there are the people who have no idea to what the hell the anthem is supposed to mean, and stand there out of mere social compliance. The last scenario is particularly concerning, because not only are there people blindly pledging their allegiance to ideals they're oblivious to, but some people do it simply to avoid being ostracized by the more radically patriotic members of our society. I find this particularly irritating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first issue, which I've already touched upon, is not everyone can definitively agree on what or what not the anthem represents. I'd argue that often times the anthem is a projection of an individual's own subjective opinion of what they believe it represents. Not every American looks through the same lens. Some people love America because of its opportunities, others for its values, its ideologies, its culture\\-\\-the list goes on. The fact that we all have our own reasons to why we love or even hate America means that standing \\(or kneeling\\) for the national anthem is going to bear different levels of significance for different people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second issue, which is the more important issue at hand, is that refusing to participate in the national anthem is seen as abhorrent, unpatriotic behavior. Some people go as far as saying that by not participating in the national anthem that you somehow hate America. Really? You're telling me that by not going through the mundane motions of the same old song\\-and\\-dance that I've done a thousand times, that I hate my own country? Maybe you could argue that I'm not a true patriot in the traditional sense, and probably that's true, but I'd argue that my right to choose whether or not I wish to participate in the anthem is the epitome of American values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever you think about America, the term 'freedom' probably comes to the forefront, but for me that isn't always the case. Often I feel our social and cultural atmosphere dictates a vast amount of our behaviors in ways we are unaware of, and in some cases\\-\\-like the one I'm trying to highlight\\-\\-can impede on our individual liberties. I shouldn't be harassed just because I don't want to participate in what feels like an out\\-dated, almost cult\\-like tradition. As a child going through primary school, it always seemed odd to me that I had to pledge my allegiance to a piece of fabric every single morning before class could even begin. It wasn't until around middle school that I had finally decided I was no longer going to participate in the strange ritual. I remember the first time a teacher of mine noticed me protesting the pledge. She stopped the entire class just to scold me and try to force me to participate. When I refused, I was immediately punished and given detention. The idea that I was being punished for not participating in the obsessive utterance of these words was ludicrous to me even as a twelve\\-year\\-old. In spite of this, my contentious behavior on the matter continued throughout my high school years, and along the entire way I was met with friction by my teachers enforcing me to participate. Now this behavior was admittedly partially due to my rebellious disposition at the time, but mostly the idea that I had to align myself to a certain set of values and then pledge my so\\-called allegiance to said values felt inherently wrong to me.\n",

      "Now this begs the question: Is there such a thing as 'forced\\-patriotism', and does it inhibit our individual liberties? I think it does, but not it ways that are obvious. This idea of patriotism is imposed on us at such an early age, that we become indoctrinated into this artificial ideal, where we often go through the motions without truly thinking about why we do them. Now I'm not saying that if you participate in the national anthem to show your patriotism that you're some brain\\-washed drone blindly adhering to an out\\-dated tradition. If the national anthem has meaning to you, and participating in it brings you joy, then by all means do it \\(Insert Shia LaBeouf here\\).

This line was trying to convey that MTG has a much bigger variance in the composition of its decks than the other leaders as far as rarity goes.

      "Think outside the box my people - throughout all of the GoW games, Kratos shows that he is unbound by fate and is always flipping prophecies upside down and inside out - this has been set as a big part of his story since the Greek pantheon. It's silly to think that because Kratos is depicted dying in a mural, that he is going to stay dead. SILLY I TELL YOU.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Faye foresaw this whole game, that's true. The giants' mural *does* show Kratos dying. With Faye being correct this whole game, why wouldn't we believe the giants' mural? Well sit your **sweet ass** down because I'll tell ya why we shouldn't *fully* believe that mural. Think about it: If the giants' foresight was absolute, they would not be in the position that they are in now. In fact, nothing would ever go wrong for the giants as a race if their foresight was so powerful. However, every story that Mimir tells about the giants ends very poorly for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This mixed with the fact that Kratos is always dicking up everyone's plans, prophecies, and fates, I highly doubt that Kratos will actually die and stay dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, Kratos may very well die, but I believe that he will do it on purpose, hence the word \"deceit\" in the mural. *But why would he die on purpose?!* Because in Norse mythology, when you die in battle, you are brought to Asgard, which we can safely assume Kratos will travel to in one way or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I highly doubt that the Valkyries were in the game just to serve as optional bosses. The Valkyries were in this game for a reason. We released the Valkyries from their corrupted forms in this game, which means that if and when Kratos dies in the next game, the Valkyries will bring him to Asgard. I believe that if Kratos dies at all, he will do it willingly as a means to get into Asgard, and will definitely not stay dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where it gets interesting. Freya now hates Kratos and wants to parade his cold dead body throughout all of the realms. Yeesh. In Norse mythology, (if they stay true to this part), Freya has the first pick of the dead when they go to Asgard. She picks who she wants to stay in her meadow, Fólkvangr, and the other half go to the halls of Valhalla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Freya keeps him in Fólkvangr or sends him to Valhalla can be seen as sinister or helpful depending on whether they become allies again prior to Kratos' deceitful trip to Asgard...\n",

      "I’m not the type of person to jump head first into trends just for the sake of it, but I do like feeling relevant and up to date. I would say my style leans more into the classic/feminine aesthetic — I’m 5’2 and not willowy thin, so I find that my body tends to suit more figure-hugging shapes. I work at a fashion museum with two other women also in their early-to-mid twenties. They both have what I’d call the current ‘cool girl’ aesthetic down: think black goucho pants or pleated skirt, white crew neck, white Adidas sneakers, eclectic combo of minimalist chokers/piercings/rings, black Matt &amp; Nat backpack etc. Compared to them I often feel fairly out of date and (dare I say) even frumpy! I like lots of these pieces individually but find that when I combine it all in one outfit I just can’t pull it off and I don’t love the look. I see baggy top on baggy bottoms being worn a lot, but if I wear a baggy item of clothing I feel the need to compensate with a fitted piece elsewhere. It also doesn’t help that I have a pixie cut so anything too androgynous or loose makes me feel very un-feminine and self conscious. How do you balance staying current and relevant with dressing to suit your own tastes and body types? Also, how do you not feel outdated when around women who completely rock the current ‘cool girl’ look? \n",

      "However what I want to discuss is from [Jackfrags video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xegBXGaFrOU) that told us about gameplay changes. It seems DICE is finally going into the direction of challenging players with a new Battlefield. \n",

      "All these hints are not only cool in a immersion they also are actually challenging ideas that I will have to spend more than a game or 4 to get used to. Although I love these games the transition from BF3 to BF4 wasn’t that substantial and it took me a couple games and 1 YouTube video to figure out how to play best. Same thing with BF4 to BF1 except maybe a little longer because of the time period difference. I feel like I’m going to start off Battlefield V as a bad player and actually learn for a couple of weeks or even months on how to be a good player, and that’s a great thing. I’m excited to be challenged by Battlefield game and actually learn in depth meta that could take weeks or even months to fully grasp. \n",
      "\n",
      "What’s even better is that in another [Jackfrags video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mSppHRDUHOU&amp;t=610s) about “*Tides of War*”, there DLC model, DICE apparently wants each new front or maps to introduce new meta you have to learn. With him using an example that the maps dropping in November will be about Dunkirk and defending against Blitzkrieg. And although the main base of gameplay changes will be the core meta to learn, this will still be fun and challenging to get used to. If they pull it off each front will play differently which will be really nice for map variety and gameplay variety. \n",

      "All of these new things and they could’ve just copied trends and made a BR game, they could’ve just slightly updated BF1 and change a few things to make it a new game (no hate meant but Black Ops 4 looks very much like an updated Black Ops 3).

      "2) yes, a resident\n",

The cops come and Mary explains that she is a resident and listed as such on the lease agreement. Cops ask DN about this he reluctantly confirms that it is true.

      "More importantly, he had been imprisoned for nearly two days. It was almost time for his initial confrontation with King Ender. Octavian had certainly had chances to stop by the set and show him the revised script; of course, the Commander hadn’t yet. \n",

      "Kyle knew that he never would. *Because the script is a fake. Because no one else can know of its existence.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Bringing the script onto the prison set had the potential to ruin everything Octavian had planned. Of course, the producers and their assistants would never ask to read it, but they would certainly speculate that there had been rewrites. That would lead to gossip. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was obvious that Octavian couldn’t afford for anyone to see them together. That Octavian had done this dozens of times already. He knew what he was doing.\n",

      "“Sorry. Of course,” Kyle replied smoothly, standing up. “I was just going over the lines in my head.” He waited for another assistant to stretch out a thick blanket across the grimy stone floor before laying flat on his chest. Another man placed a plate of smoked meat and vegetables within reach. A third added a copy of the *actual* script for a last minute review. \n",
      "\n",
      "As he feasted, Kyle rapidly flipped through the upcoming scenes. It was just as he thought. There were no changes. On the main set, the writers produced a fresh copy every day. There were subtle tweaks and potential rewordings based on the reports of the two Kings the night before. On this copy, there was nothing different. Not a single word. \n",

      "*What if…*\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this the most recent version?” he asked as the assistant continued to work. He was careful to keep his voice warm and unassuming. It wasn’t impossible that Octavian had placed a spy on set, that there were others committed to his cause. In fact, it was very likely. Everyone loved Octavian after all.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Her response didn’t surprise Kyle in the slightest. Octavian knew the inner workings of King Ender’s castle. He had been a soldier there before the actual war had even begun. That’s why the old King trusted him so much. That’s part of the reason why–\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle stopped cold. *No. That can’t be it.*\n",
      "\n",
      "But it made sense. Octavian’s ascent wouldn’t stop at taking King Ender’s place. His reign would be short-lived if the show was truly ending. No. Octavian wanted to become an *actual* king. He wasn’t thinking about simply ending the war – he was thinking about *winning* it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle glanced to where he had hidden the knife under a pile a straw that served as his *bed*. His temporary plush cot had been removed in preparation of his meeting with the King. On any other occasion, he would have thought the transformation of his cell to have been remarkable. Now, all he could think of was how to stop the rouge Commander before it was too late. \n",

It was likely that he wouldn’t get a true chance to stop Octavian until later that night, but the feeling of the knife’s hilt against his thigh was reassuring nevertheless. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few moments later, the heavy door to the dungeon was thrown open. Wearily, Kyle raised his eyes, careful to keep the left only half-open. \n",
      "\n",
      "He had performed for King George a hundred times before, but he had never even seen King Ender. The man was a few years younger than George, his long black hair flaked with gray. The King wore a thick beard that stretched down past the lavish collar of his regal red robes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle nearly broke character as he saw Octavian standing behind the king. The soldier had put on his best uniform bearing Ender’s sigil; his handsome face was freshly shaven and his thick blond hair was tied behind his neck. He subtly winked at Kyle as their eyes met. \n",
      "\n",
      "With actual disdain, Kyle glared at the other Commander. Octavian wasn’t supposed to be in this scene. *I shouldn’t be surprised at this point. He’s here to make sure I play my part.* \n",

      "“So,” King Ender began in his ancient voice. “We meet at last Commander Kyle.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“When shall I schedule the execution, my Liege?” Octavian asked.\n",

      "____\n",
      "Again, thanks for reading! I plan to post at least one more part later on today. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me elaborate on the title a little bit:\n",
      "\n",
      "As I went into my second year of college, I was growing increasingly unhappy with the lack of romance in my life. I read *My Twisted World*,  the autobiography of Elliot Rodger, a kind of incel hero who went on a  killing spree in 2014. The years of loneliness he described and his  righteous anger as he planned his retribution both resonated with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "As  my failure with women continued, I resolved to follow Elliot’s violent  example if I remained lonely by the end of my college years. I was angry   at the universe. I believed that natural selection had created men and  women in such a way that we could never truly be happy together. I  wanted to show everyone who deluded themselves into thinking that life   could be fair, or that happiness could ever be more than an incomplete,  fleeting experience, that there would always be someone like me who  slipped through the cracks of our society and destroyed any illusion of  order with senseless violence. And on a more basic level, I wanted to  make people care about me, even knowing that that caring would really be  hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these plans were two years  away, and I intended to  give the universe a fair trial until the time  came. I thought that, in college, my discomfort with dancing and the  party environment was an obstacle to being attractive to any girls. I  happened to read someone's account of the drug MDMA, \"ecstasy\", and its  legendary ability to “teach  you how to dance.” After some deliberation,  I bought some and took it at a party.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got real high, and then I never came back down.\n",
      "\n",
      "That   evening turned out to be the end of a nightmare which had lasted far  too long. As I talked to friends and strangers and felt my mind working  in ways it never had before, the uncaring universe I’d believed in was  disproved, replaced by a world of a different kind. I belonged here, and  I wanted to be here, and I was happy to share it with everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  powerful effects of the drug had tapered off by morning, but I was  changed. The hateful ruts in my mind were smoothed over for good during  those few hours of ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was more  than a year ago, and I've been gratefully exploring our bright world  ever since. But I see a nation that seems confused, about the prevalence  of mass killing, about what to make of lonely, sometimes bitter men,  about what our war on drugs is accomplishing, and more. I don't have the  answers to all these questions, but I hope my own experience can be  valuable as we wrestle with them as a society.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm writing a book telling my story, which I'm calling *Anthem for a Dream*. I want to create an anti\\-*My Twisted World*,  a story of loneliness, but one with a happy ending. You can follow my  progress on Kickstarter, if you want. \\(I think linking to it directly is  forbidden by [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA) rules, but you can find it.\\)\n",

      "We already know that **252** accounts defeated Solak during this period. Early indications are that the majority of those accounts are legitimate players not involved in abuse, but naturally we need to wait for the full reviews to be completed before we can draw any definitive conclusions.\n",

This lady had an obscene amount of food in her cart, and she was really overweight and pretty trashy looking in general. She said she was a little short on cash and if I could help her out, then I saw her deficit was over $80, and I politely told her that she would have to put some of things from her cart back. She got really angry, and said \"I've got 5 kids at home and I need to feed them, I thought you were supposed to help customers!\", I told her that she was short $84 and I couldn't do anything. My manager must've heard her temper tantrum and she asked what was happening, I explained, all the while this lady was actually crying, my manager told me I could go, and she dealt with the lady. Like an hour later my manager asked me if I tried to get the lady to HAVE SEX with me for me to pay for her groceries. I was appalled, I told her that I said no such thing, and luckily my manager understood, and I never heard anything about it afterwards.\n",

It has resulted in six shows (Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Defenders and Punisher), five of them which are on going.  It has also done a lot for the reputation of Marvel TV.  Imagine if the only Marvel shows were Agents of SHIELD, Agent Carter and Inhumans.  Without the Netflix deal we probably wouldn't have had Runaways, Cloak and Dagger, Gifted or Legion.  These shows are probably all expensive to produce.\n",

Granted, the Netflix series would never have been green lit for the Disney streaming service but the Netflix series would have been a good fit on Hulu.  The problem may have been Netflix was the more popular service and would have been able to provide better bid.  The Netflix shows may be low budget compared to the movies but the budget other formats would have been willing to provide may simply have been nonexistent.  How cheap is Cloak and Dagger going to look?  \n",

      "**Q：What's the Total Supply of Waltoncoin \\(WTC\\)?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Total Supply is 100 million coins with no further issuance in any case. The Max Supply is currently 70 million coins, with the remaining 30 million left to be mined over the course of many years. Currently, the Circulating Supply is around 25 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q：I hear Walton is moving to its own blockchain?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Main net has just been launched. Stay tuned for details about the token swap and transition to the new chain!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q：How do I convert my ERC20 WTC tokens to the real thing?**\n",
      "\n",
      "You can either leave your coins on the exchange, and they will take care of the switch for you, or you can leave them in your MEW wallet, and the team will provide details on how the tokens will be swapped over. Just sit tight! Details are coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: How do I move my WTC to MEW \\(or the new Walton Wallet\\)?**\n",
      "\n",
      "For MEW:\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Send your WTC to your wallet address.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. Add a custom token using the information below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Address: 0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74\n",
      "\n",
      "Name: WTC\n",
      "\n",
      "Decimals: 18\n",
      "\n",
      "For Walton Wallet:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not send ANY coins to this wallet yet. Wait for instructions from the team. Once everything is safe, you will be able to just create a wallet on the Walton Wallet and send your coins to the public address generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q：What if I want to keep them on my Ledger Nano?**\n",
      "\n",
      "You can do that, and the team will still snapshot your wallet and copy it along with your coins; however, the the Ledger may not support WTC currently. Don't fret. Your coins are 100&amp;#37; safe. What that means is, if there is no Ledger support, the only way to transfer your coins out of the wallet will be to expose your Ledger's private key. I don't recommend doing this, as it will make the ledger no more secure than a paper wallet \\(still very secure, but a waste of money now\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "So basically, your coins are safe. You can still mine to the address. You just won't be able to move them until Ledger support comes. But if you really need access to the coins, you can break out the Ledger's private key on MEW and log into your wallet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ledger support will come, we just don't know exactly when. Walton is also making their own Walton hardware wallets. I'll update this with more information as it comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q：My GMN is on MEW. Will I ever be able to secure GMN in a hardware wallet?**\n",
      "\n",
      "As you know, moving your GMN will void your Guardian status because it is attached to the wallet containing at least 5000 WTC; however, the team has stated that they are working on a solution for this and have reassured us that our coins will be safe. We will have to wait for more information regarding whether the transferring of a GMN to a new address will be possible in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q：What is the utility of WTC? What gives the coin value?**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the WaltonChain Ecosystem WTC will have multiple functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Issuing sub chains\n",
      "* Dividend interest\n",
      "* Credit and mortgage system\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes. Waltonchain is a smart contract platform that will have ICOs and dApps.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: But I thought Walton just tracked clothing in the supply chain. What else can it do?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton is capable of implementation in smart cities, smart waste management systems, and things of that nature. That's certainly beyond supply chain. Walton isn't so much a \"supply chain\" coin as it is a Big Data coin. The RFIDs are used to gather data, which is very useful in supply chain management. But it can also be used to combine with smart devices and make an Internet of things network.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Why does this need a blockchain?**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is difficult for the Internet of things under the current central structure to accomplish real autonomous cooperation and effective transactions, because the relevant parties of such cooperation and transactions often belong to different stakeholders with complex and uncertain trust relationships. Therefore, the collaboration and transactions of the current Internet of Things devices can only be carried out under the same trust domain. That is to say, the devices to collaborate and trade must be provided or verified by the same Internet of Things service provider, which significantly reduces the true commercial value of the Internet of Things applications.\" \\(Page 2 of the [Whitepaper](https://www.waltonchain.org/upload/1507947652573.pdf)\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "To expand, counterfeiting is an obvious answer to this question. There needs to be a way to truly authenticate an item. Blockchain is that answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walton's blockchain also removes data silos. Companies won't have to manage any database anymore. Everything is handled by Walton. Walton uses child chains which are separate from the parent chain. Companies can keep proprietary information secret and private on their child chain, and only broadcast necessary information to the parent chain for public viewing. Blockchains make the sharing of info between companies easy and fast, too. And then obviously, blockchains have perfect transparency and are immutable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart contracts are also extremely useful. In the supply chain industry, after perfectly counting and storing inventory, things can be auto\\-ordered and paid for simultaneously with wtc, just as an example. Your mind can come up with a whole host of other ideas related to automation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, decentralized, transparent, and immutable data for things like smart waste management systems, which Walton has designed, and air\\-pollution monitoring systems in smart cities would benefit greatly from the blockchain, for reasons explained in the first point from the whitepaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could also imagine on the customer end that wanting to know where all their goods come from is important. This is in line with counterfeiting, but also with things more benign. Imagine wanting to return an item to a store, but can't remember which grocery store it was from. Lots of simple improvements like that are all use cases for blockchain.\n",

      "\n",
      "One is a Smart City contracted by a local Korean govt. monitoring air particles \\(no further specifics\\). Another is based in the agriculture industry \\(no further specifics\\), and another is [Freyrchain](http://www.freyrchain.org/index.html), a culture and arts chain. The other three have not been revealed yet.\n",

      "**Q: I heard Waltonchain has patented technology. What are the patents?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Walton team has filed filed for 13 patents, 7 of which have been approved so far. The patents cover many inventions in chip design, but the main one of interest is the Transaction ID\\-reading RFID chip with memory storage. This allows the blockchain to be implemented in the Foundational layer through the RFIDs themselves. The chips can generate their own random ID hash within a secure Key Generation Center within the chip, and the hash along with the data are uploaded simultaneously to the blockchain via their RFID reader. This makes WaltonChain fully decentralized and secure.\n",

      "**Q：What are the advantages of the RFID IC tag chip designed in this project?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing RFID chip industry cannot meet the development of Internet of Things applications, especially applications for the Value Internet of Things:\n",

      "* There are few options available while the prices are high\n",
      "* The transmission power and stability need to be improved\n",
      "* The reception sensitivity is low\n",
      "* The anti\\-interference ability is poor and the transmission power is low\n",
      "* The existing RFID ICs have many problems such as high power consumption, poor matching with antennae, and difficult system integration, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project’s IC design has the following significant advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* High security: The chip integrates asymmetric random password pair generation logic, uses a core asymmetric encryption algorithm with independent intellectual property rights, and an optimized design without increasing the cost and power consumption of the chip, enabling higher communication security\n",
      "* Tamper\\-resistant: A dedicated storage space is integrated into the tag chip for the storage of hash value of tag status and key information\n",
      "* Optimized anti\\-collision design: The chip uses a binary tree anti\\-collision algorithm with independent intellectual property rights and a time division multiple access design, significantly improving the tag recognition success rate and the number of identifiable labels at the same time\n",
      "* High sensitivity: The chip uses an optimized noise suppression technology to improve the noise figure at the receiving end and the overall receiver sensitivity, which plays an important role in increasing the recognition success rate\n",
      "* Good compatibility: The chip can achieve high\\-frequency and ultra\\-high frequency functions at the same time, so the end customer can read the information through their smart phone and inquire about reliable product information\n",
      "* Long lasting: The chip adopts a low voltage and low power\\-consumption design, allowing the chip to last more than 20 years  \n",

      "[Waltonchain in a nutshell with COO Monitor Chan](http://chinacryptonews.com/interview-waltonchain-monitor-chan/):\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We develop and produce hardware such as chips ourselves. This really differentiates us from other companies at the moment. Basically, Silitec, our technical support company, was founded in 2015 and is specialized in manufacturing chips. They already have a R&amp;D team of around 20\\+ people, so in that way we are not 'increasing' cost. Next important detail is that Waltonchain’s blockchain technology is written into our chips. This means that unlike traditional RFID chips that have their own specific ID and cost around $0.15 to $0.20, the chips we develop will be below 5 cents. With the volume of sales increasing, the overall cost will spread over many units, and the system's cost and ID’s cost will go down consequently, or simply put, economics of scale will do the work.\"\n",

      "Destiny 2 is the game made by Organization XIII when Square-Enix took a decade and a half to release Kingdom Hearts 3. Much like the nobodies of the Kingdom Hearts universe, Destiny 2 is a game that is superficially beautiful and perfect – outwardly, everything looks okay. It has great graphics, a solid graphical style, and decent gunplay.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when you go past the surface, you realize that there’s nothing inside – the game has no heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny 2 is basically a Borderlands MMORPG – a looter-shooter, with some PvP arena multiplayer thrown in. It is a MMORPG – you constantly see players around you in the world – which of course makes the game’s single-player campaign, of you being the LONE GUARDIAN who has REGAINED THEIR LIGHT (i.e. their superpowers) into a bit of a farce, what with all those other lone heroes who saved the world running around with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let’s face it – you don’t care about the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s a problem, really, because Destiny 2, like all games, needs something for you to care about. But the problem is, Destiny 2 doesn’t provide it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world? There’s pretty much no real lore to it – everything feels very arbitrary. You fight some bad guys, but there’s no real coherence to it. You have some allies, but they’re just kind of there. What’s the point of it all? I don’t even know, as I never really got to care about any of them. You don’t spend a whole lot of time around any of them, and they’re mostly about business rather than having any sort of personal character that you’d latch onto. Cayde is the “funny irresponsible one”, and the others are… pretty much just various kinds of military leaders, really. There’s a sniper in one area who is an older guy who wants to be left to snipe in peace, but while he babbles about personal stuff a little (more so than other people), there’s not really enough there to latch onto.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what are the stakes? There really aren’t any. Destiny 2 has the shape of a world, but it has none of the form or substance, and it is blatantly there just to deliver on its looter shooter nature.\n",

      "You might think that good core gameplay would make up for this fact. Alas, it really doesn’t. The game does have decent variety for a campaign of its (fairly brief) length – you’ve got a reasonable variety of big beefy guys who move around on jetpacks and who are pretty tough, machine enemies with glowy spots in non-standard locations as their weapon point rather than just the head, more slender, agile enemies who spend a lot of time running around, and the “magical” enemies lead by flying wizards. Each of these factions has multiple enemy types, including a few different types that can be made into bosses, and they work well enough for what they are – but the problem is that it all ultimately feels rather hollow. The optimal strategy against all of them is either “stand behind cover and shoot until you’re injured, then go behind it to heal” or “just keep shooting the melee enemies as they keep rushing at you”. It is only in a few places that the game really does anything to mix this up, having enemies spawn in behind you and forcing you to move, or having enemies rush at you to melee you while there’s a bunch of enemies providing covering fire, and these dynamic moments are where the game is the most fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "But most of the game is not this, but is instead a bunch of fairly static, stale encounters where you are more or less just gunning down bad guys ahead of you. And while these are actually okay from time to time, the game simply cannot subsist off of these sorts of mechanics for all that long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is that the campaign is about the right length for what it is, but [i]this is a looter shooter[/i], meaning that the real focus of the game is to play it over and over again to try and grind for better gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is here that the game utterly fails, because the game mechanics simply cannot endure such repeated exposure. The game has already shown the player pretty much everything it has to offer in the main body of the campaign, and by the end of it, the player is maximum level and has a nice set of equipment. All that is left at that point is a bunch of side-quests – which are no different from what came before – and the PvP, which, while decent, isn’t anything particularly remarkable compared to games like Overwatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the game runs out of steam as the player is about to hit the grind phase, and there’s just no reason to stick around – the game doesn’t really have anything left to show the player at that point, just more of the same, so what is the point of even grinding?\n",
      "\n",
      "But the utter lack of any sort of heart to the single player campaign means that there wasn’t any point to that, either – it was a setup, a prelude to the looter-shooter endgame, but it wasn’t really all that fun or memorable. Stuff happens, but there’s no one to latch onto and no world to really get involved with. Characters like Cayde-6 and Failsafe feel like they’re aping characters like Deadpool and GlaDOS, albeit without the charm and wit that they had, while the other characters are all even more forgettable, with me even confusing the names of two of the main “heroes” on a constant basis. Indeed, even now I struggle to remember the names of even half of the NPCs in the game, and the PC themselves, as a silent protagonist, has no character at all (an odd choice, considering that your companion constantly chatters to people and at you).\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is that everything just feels like it turns to ash in your mouth. The main campaign is an empty experience, and there’s no reason to care about the end game stuff, either. The game is almost entirely competent mechanically, with only the odd hiccup here and there, but it is all in service to an ultimately hollow experience that never manages to engage the audience and make them care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even for the people who just want to grind, Destiny 2 seems to fall down. In the endgame, after reaching the level cap, you eventually reach the point where the only way to get better gear is to complete one of a handful of weekly challenges. After you’ve done those tasks, there’s no way to get better gear until the weekly reset. While this discourages people from just spending their whole life grinding away, it also means that you can’t even do the raid (the centerpiece of end-game content) until you’ve spent about a real-life *month* dong that end-game weekly grind, if not more.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I can’t really recommend this game to anyone. The Borderlands games do what this game does, but better, and with more style and flair, and while characters in Borderlands may not have the same agility they have in Destiny 2, the game just does more to engage you. And likewise, games like Overwatch pull off the PvP much better than this game can hope to. It isn’t that Destiny is bad, per se, so much as that it never manages to actually be good – only inoffensive at best. But a game needs to actually be good to be worth playing, and Destiny 2 never crosses that threshold.\n",

      "In can't remember exactly how old I was but we were living in our first house so I was no older than seven. I used to, like many children, get up early on Sunday mornings and watch children's television. Recently, I had a flash of nostalgia and wanted to look up the intros all my favourite shows from the early 90's so I searched for them in YouTube.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found The Fruities, The Biskitts, A Pup Named Scooby Doo to name just a few but there's one I can't find any trace of. It was called 'The Cockadoos' and it was an American/Canadian cartoon about a cockerel who lived in a hen shed on a farm with his family (The Cockadoos) and would spend every episode trying to be famous. I asked my mum if she remembers this and she said yes but it was a bit naughty for a children's TV show because they used to say, \"clucking heck!\" and \"cluck you!\" My sister even recalls one scene where the mother (who always wore a yellow, frilly apron) put a frying pan on the floor and sat on it. You just saw her cartoon face staining and then there was a crack sound. She put the pan on the cooker which now had a cracked open egg in it and said, \"Kids, breakfast is almost ready.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "However, me and my sister both remembered the catchy theme song and began singing it together. Then we remembered something else really strange. The main character - whose name I can't remember - was, on one particular episode, trying to make himself famous and was doing different wacky things to become a celebrity on the net, which seemed kind of strange as children of the early 90s wouldn't have been able to relate to jokes about the internet. \n",
      "\n",
      "However the craziest thing is this: In one scene I remember in detail that the main character recorded himself and some of the other animals catapulting themselves into the air in crash helmets.

I even recall that every time they checked to see how many \"hits\" they had, a big picture would appear on their computer screen of a red rectangle with a white hoof print inside - obviously a reference to the YouTube red and white play icon. \n",
      "\n",
      "She told me that YouTube wasn't invented until the early 2000s.

      "I speculated whether we were older and were mixing it up with a similar show but my sister, who would have been 10 or 11 at the time (I was 6 or 7) was sure it was at our first house which we left when I was 7.

      "Literally there's no trace of this show on the internet. No one knows what we're talking about. No one we know outside our household even vaguely remembers it. My sister said to me last night that given the MooTube reference, maybe it hasn't been invented yet and we were watching something from the future. I laughed at first. We both did. But now I'm wondering. I don't ever remember it being announced by presenters or featured in the 'up next' line up. We just used to flick through until we found it.

They’d only decided they wanted to go there on the day of meeting, so we weren’t able to book in advance – I warned them that this might mean we couldn’t get in there and needed to pick somewhere else, as it was quite busy when I’d been in the past, but they were happy either way.

Now, my Dad and Step-Mum are unfamiliar with the city where I live and obviously the restaurant (which isn’t very easy to find if you don't know what you're looking for) so I said “If you don’t mind, I’ll wait out front in case I need to direct them”. They said fine, so I waited just outside the doors.

      "I really didn't enjoy my first experience at the Supreme store in London, after trying every Tuesday for the past few weeks to get a spot in line I had finally got one for the week 15 drop, so I booked my ticket for the hour and a half train journey and turned up 10 mins early to my dedicated time. The Security guards where pleasant and had a good system for keeping the line moving so it took about 30 mins to get into Supreme, we had to show our ID and credit card and where told no phones allowed and bags to be left at the door. Once inside the store you have clothes on racks and you have to ask the staff on the shop floor if they have your size in stock and then they ask another staff member that is on a balcony above you and they check and throw it down to the staff at the bottom, so I asked if they had the playboy top in blue and medium size and was told they had completely sold out. I didn’t think much of it because it’s a hyped item, I was able to get the other stuff I liked and headed towards the line to pay. There is only one till so the time to wait is a little while so I was watching other people get their items and some kids walked up to the staff member who told me the top was sold out and fist pumped him and seemed to know him and asked if he had the blue playboy top in stock and he said yes and called up to get the group a top each. I felt that was a bit strange but maybe they found some extra stock so when I got to the till I asked them if they had any of them in stock and he called to the other staff member who looked at me and said “none in XL” and It kind of caught me off guard so I replied, “I’m looking for a medium” and he said they “sold out of all of the tops”. His comments felt really unnecessary, the whole atmosphere there felt tense and uninviting. You feel like you have to go in there quickly and get your things as fast as possible and get out, you also feel like you’re walking on eggshells and making sure you don’t touch the wrong thing or look at your phone and upset security, the staffs’ attitudes are rude and uncaring and it seems you can only get hyped items if you are buddies with them. I have read before that “the skater community is not nice and they’re supposed to be assholes” but I have a lot of skater friends who are incredibly nice and friendly and Palace around the corner from Supreme are always helpful, they strike up conversations and it feels relaxing to browse there. \n",
      "If you where thinking of going to the store on drop day and you’re traveling there, I wouldn’t bother, it’s too much hassle and the experience isn’t worth it, I think I’ll cop online for now on.\n",
      "\n",
      "TDLR; Cop online.\n",
      "It's easy for the common man to throw up his hands and proclaim, \"I give up! This is worthless!\" IT takes a courageous man to say \"I am everything. With enough hard work, I will make it,\" and go on to prove it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, you are feeling frustrated and angry that your goals are not coming to fruition, and you are about to give up. Don't. Here are some words of encouragement to push you forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "This should be obvious, but it helps to be reminded that nothing worth anything in life comes easily. It has been written many times that those who have achieved greatness failed thousands of times before they made a breakthrough. You probably haven't failed even one-hundred times. Being who you are, there is a tendency to dramatize everything, distorting reality, and eventually giving up mentally and physically. You must catch yourself in these foolish moments, and remind yourself that it could take up to a decade to master a skill. Do not be like the quitters who give up within their first year. Do not let your fear of failure overshadow your desire to be great.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is tendency for you to procrastinate on your responsibilities because you cannot bear to be humbled by the fact your skills are more lackluster than you thought. This is the mark of a boy. A man realizes that the rewards of the long term far outweigh the situation of the present, and so he continues to set his emotions aside, and work. Work until the desired end result is achieved. For as long as the work is put in, the end result is guaranteed. Have confidence you will arrive, and soon you will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not compare yourself to others. Do not worry about what others are doing. You have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, only what they present to you. How can you be sure that they are telling the truth about the amount of time it took them — for example — to get good at drawing? Or whether the work they present is their own? There isn't a way to truly know and it does not matter. Your journey is ultimately your own and as long as you are doing everything you have to do and maintaining discipline, it will take as long as it needs to for you to achieve your desired result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relax. There will be days of rapid progress, just as there will be periods of stagnation. Understand that both are completely normal and you shouldn't feel any intense attachment towards either. Attachment to rapid progress will form unrealistic expectations of yourself, ending in disappointment. Attachment to periods of stagnation will cause your mind to go to dark places, experience chronic frustration, and you will eventually give up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution to this is to adopt an attitude of indifference. A mindset that effectively says, \"I don't care about this situation I'm in, only my goal. As long as I'm showing up everyday, I'll get there.\" This attitude will help you embrace boredom, and failure more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously stated, this path towards reaching your goals has left you currently frustrated and angry, and probably ready to give up. Don't. Be the courageous man that says to himself, \"I am everything,\" and sets out to prove it.\n",
      "My old high school was having issues with students vaping in the bathrooms, and the response from administration was to lock down all the bathrooms on campus except 4 (2 men’s, 2 women’s). This has been going on for about a month. Admin has been lying to parents about the bathrooms being locked down (saying it was only a couple days, that the bathrooms are open now, etc), while students have been complaining of impossible wait times at lunch and disgusting messes in those open bathrooms that go untouched for days. One student I know couldn’t find an open bathroom at school while on her period and ruined several articles of clothing. Are there any laws/educational codes against this? It’s becoming a serious stressor for my friends &amp; family who still attend this school.\n",

      "We all love out privacy, right? Some families, like my FHs,  have an \"open door\" policy, where everyone leaves their doors unlocked and visitors are welcome anytime. This is the story of how I put a stop to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When FH and I first moved in together, it was a spare bedroom at my mother's house. Then it was a teeny tiny flat, owned by a lovely older couple whose son, we later found out, was dating my older sister- so naturally they were like extended family and we saw them all the time. So when we finally got a place with room to move around in, and no relatives living literally in the next room over, we were in heaven. Freedom!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Except, no. You see, FIL popped over one night on his way home from work, about 7.30pm, and we welcomed him in- how nice of him to come by! He stayed for an hour and left. A few nights later he did the same thing. And a few nights after that. And a few nights after that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For four years, FIL would show up on any random evening. Sometimes we wouldn't see him all week. Sometimes we'd see him every night for two weeks straight. Didn't matter if we had friends over, or were eating dinner, or were just on our way out, or eating junk and playing games. I begged FH to say something, anything, at least tell him to call or text first, but I was told \"That's just how our family is\". My own mother tried to visit without calling ONCE and I was firm yet polite when I informed her that wasn't appropriate. Her reaction was to offer to \"make an appointment\" next time, to which I beamed and told her it was a fantastic idea. Because boundaries and independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But even relaying this to FIL didn't work. Asking him directly, did not work, hinting to MIL did not work. Locking the door so he couldn't just waltz in didn't work, because if the lights were on he would knock and knock until FH opened up. I can't count the number of times I've run past the front door and up the stairs to get dressed because FIL has just *appeared*. Eventually even FH started to get annoyed by it, but still FIL was oblivious. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when an opportunity landed in my lap, I took it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the last few months of this torture, I had taken to wearing exclusively t-shirts and panties around the house. No bra for my ample bosom. No trousers. And when unexpected visitors (FIL) arrived, I would drape a blanket across my legs and apologise that I could not get them a drink, sorry, they'll have to make the visit quick, ETC. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the golden moment. I was in the bath, relaxing after a hard day, and FH had gone out with a friend, so our car was still in its usual spot. And then the knocking starts. And I ignore it. And the knocking continues, and I dunk myself under the water and internally scream for at the interloper to fuck off. And then he's *hammering* on the door like there's a bloody fire or something, so I throw a towel round myself and run down the stairs, thinking a neighbour is in serious trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can see it's FIL, and I face a choice: go get dressed? Nah. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I flung open the door and asked what the emergency was. FIL paled. I'm in nothing but a towel. My hair is wet. There are bubbles trailing down my leg. It's. Not. A. Good. Time. He stammered, asked where FH is, and I reply curtly \"out.\" I stand in the doorway, staring him down. I make a remark about beating the door down like the house is on fire. He blushes and asks if FH will be home soon, I tell him \"I don't know, FIL,  why don't you call him?\" FIL mumbles something and adverts his gaze. I offer to let him come in and wait, but I'm going back to my bath, and I shrug, letting more bathwater drip all over the carpet. FIL struggles to look me in the eye. I have the snarkiest, smirkiest raised eyebrow I can manage. I am marking my territory and my privacy. He declines to come in. I wave enthusiastically and basically slam the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FIL goes home. And I say nothing to FH except \"your dad stopped by but I was busy so he left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And it doesn't end there. A few days later we are at the ILs (called ahead like civilised folk) and MIL makes a comment about FIL going to visit us and FH not being home. FH states that no one told him to expect visitors, and MIL makes a vague suggestion that I was rude and did not invite FIL in to wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So I go in for the kill. I explain that I did invite him in, but that I had been bathing, and answered the door in a towel, with bubblebath running down my legs! How funny! How embarrassing! I heard the knocking and thought it was an emergency, because *surely* no one would be that persistent! How silly of me! It's a good thing FIL didn't stay because FH took hours to come home and that would've been *so awkward!* \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FIL took me to one side and told me the story was a bit inappropriate and he'd appreciate it if I didn't repeat it. I apologised (genuinely sorry for humiliating him) and haven't had to mention it since.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FIL now visits on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 7 and 8pm. Sometimes he doesn't turn up, which is annoying, but I know when to expect him. He sometimes calls ahead to check we're in, with a snarky comment about \"oh you're not *busy*, are you?\" Sometimes I desperately want to say \"yes, actually, twice a week is a bit much, don't you think?\" But it's been three years, and as long as he sticks to his schedule or calls before he visits, I won't push it.\n",

      "So, instead of treating a woman like she is a goddess, focus on having fun and treating her like your annoying little sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? Because when you place a woman on a pedestal and treat her like she is a queen, it shows that you have little to no value, no options with other women, and you’re just an ass-kisser who wants to get in her pants.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you treat her like your annoying ass little sister, your interaction will be playful, and you will show her that you’re care-free, fun, and you’re not going to take shit from her.\n",

      "Most men try to be perfect and super polite on a date, and instead of having an awesome date, it ends up being boring and forced.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Strong eye contact shows a woman that you’re engaged in the conversation and the moment with her. It shows her that you’re listening to her. It shows her that you have nothing to hide. It shows her that you’re confident. When you avoid eye contact you display all the “opposite” qualities of what I mentioned above, and you will have a tough time creating a strong connection on your date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being vulnerable is powerful because most guys refuse to do it. Most guys try to act cool, or tough, or macho, but few traits are more cool, tough, or macho than being vulnerable.\n",

      "* Guild Wars 2 caters to both **casual** and **hardcore** players. I'm going to focus on the level of dedication and the toughness of content here.\n",
      "   * **Casual**: There's no pressure to keep up with armor, no need to log in every day, ...You can play at your own pace, set your own goals, basically do whatever you prefer.Open World content can be done alone and there's no need to min\\-max for this content.Dungeons aren't too hard &amp; finding groups for them is easy via the group finder.Some dungeons are a tad harder but they're perfectly do\\-able with the right gear.There's no gear treadmil.The difference between exotic \\(easiest and 2nd best armor tier\\) and ascended gear \\(the 'best' gear\\) is only a 5&amp;#37; increase for said stats. Exotic armor is easily obtainable via dungeons, drops, crafting, just playing really.I'm not going to expand any further since it's pretty obvious, this game can be played very very casually in a way of difficulty and time \\- you don't need to invest a lot of time to have fun!\n",
      "   * **Hardcore**: People who're looking for tougher content \\(than open world / dungeons\\) have a multitude of options so satisfy their cravings.\n",
      "      * ***Raids***: Yup, Guild Wars has raids too \\- divided in wings and they're the hardest content. They're also based on mechanics and there are of course meta team compositions. Raids are cleared in parties of 10.\n",
      "      * ***Fractals***: These are progressive mini\\-dungeons. They're shorter than the actual dungeons but they're also divided in levels \\(sort of like Mythics in WoW\\). You start out at fractal level 1 and progress your way up to 100. The dungeons get harder per level and people like to clear the higher levels as fast as possible and / or solo even.\n",
      "      * ***Legendaries*** :Okay, I kind of lied about the gear, ascended isn't the last tier. Legendary armor, weapons and trinkets are the last tier. There's no stat increase over ascended though!What's the difference then? Well legendary weapons have extra animations \\(glows, fire, ice, ...\\) and when sheathed and moving some of them kind drop drips of... your weapon. You can also change your stat combination on the fly \\(whereas for exotic/ascended you would have to craft a whole new set\\).Okay so fancypants weapons and the ease of changing my stats, wow that's not hardcore... Well they take quite some time to craft and assemble. Going for a legendary on it's own can be quite a time sink &amp; therefor huge goal. Casual players don't let this spook you. There's RNG involved too and just playing the game will passively net you a nice chunk of the required materials. Hardcore players just like to \"grind\" them so I included it under this section.\n",
      "      * ***Achievements***:There are various achievements to be earned. Tied to the story, PvP, WvW, ... rewarding you achievement points \\(AP\\) &amp; some times extra rewards \\(gold, armor, armor skins, ...\\). Some people like to AP Hunt and gather as many AP as they can.Every 500 AP you also get a chest and some passive account bonusses \\(xp gain increase, gold gain increase, ...\\) .Every 5K AP you get a bigger chest with more items, more gold, a title, ...Some achievements are easy to get or just require some time \\(kill X spiders\\), others require more skill, patience or a mix of all of the above \\(wouldn't be AP hunting otherwise\\)....\n",
      "* **PvE** \\- I'll discuss the PvE content more here\n",
      "   * **Open World \\-** The open world on its own provides for quite a bit of content. GW2 doesn't really use traditional \\(side\\)questing. Maps are filled with **Heart quests, vistas, points of interest &amp; dynamic events.**\n",
      "      * **Heart Quests** can be found on the map and are automatically \"active\" once you enter the vicinity. On the top right corner you'll see how you can progress these and once they're done you get rewarded without having to even talk to an NPC. There is however always an NPC that becomes a vendor once you complete a heart quest. These sell a variety of things \\- not always useful but still good to know.\n",
      "      * **Vistas** are kind of like towers in assassins creed. They don't reveal the map more but they give you a cinematic view of the area/landscape and they also count for your map completion.\n",
      "      * **POIs** \\(points of interest\\) are your standard landmarks and sometimes landmarks from GW1. Interesting zones, buildings, ruins, ... They also count for map completion.\n",
      "      * **Dynamic events** can pop up at any time \\(some have fixed cooldowns\\) and anyone running around can participate. They're pretty fun and a very good way to level inbetween heart quests and a good way to keep things interesting.\n",
      "      * **There's also Event chains**. They're basically multiple events chained to one another.There's just so much to do in the open world apart from all this but this is actual content.\n",
      "   * **Dungeons**\n",
      "      * Your standard 5\\-man dungeon that has 2 \"modes\".\n",
      "      * *Storymode* \\(mandatory to finish these to start your own exploration mode group\\). These are tied to the story and as soon as your eligible to do these, you'll get a mail ingame.\n",
      "      * *Exploration mode* is where it's at though. The dungeons get harder and they get divided into 3 paths \\- you choose \\(as a party\\) which path you'll do somewhere at the start of the dungeon.You can only do 1 path per time so you can basically gain rewards for the same dungeon 3 times and you get a bonus if you clear all 3 once per day.These dungeons give you dungeon tokens and gold. The tokens can be used to buy those dungeons' armor sets \\(they all have their own skins and 3 stat combinations to choose between\\).\n",
      "   * **Personal Story**This is basically your main quest. This is in the form of a more traditional questing system \\( a questlog, NPCs to talk to, ...\\) and actually has a story/advances your character in the story. The story overall isn't *super* but it ain't bad either.HOWEVER Arenanet has decided to continue developing the story via the Living World Story. The living world is **basically extra FR**EE content we get every x weeks \\(Schedule varies\\) that keep advancing the story after the base game and the seasons are also tied and sometimes in between the expansions. They add new maps, missions/quests, achievements, armor, ...They really want to keep the world alive and the story advancing which is very very nice.\n",
      "   * **Fractals**\n",
      "   * **Raids**\\(as explained above\\)\n",
      "* **PVP**I actually find the PvP very enjoyable.It's a domination/conquest type of game mode and can be played \\(un\\)ranked and solo or duo. You **don't** need to be max level to play.You can create a character, do the intro and immediately port to the lobby.PvP gear is based on stat trinkets &amp; runes that are the same for everyone. You get most of them on the fly \\(at least the popular ones\\), some you have to \"pay\" for with gold but it isn' much and it's usually very specific \\(less used\\) runes and such.The beauty of PvP is that you can\\*\\* earn PvE rewards via rew**ard tracks. That way you can still go for that legendary or a specific \\(dungeon\\*\\) **armor se\\*\\*t even if you only play PVP.\n",
      "* **WvW** \\(World vs. World vs. World\\)In this gamemode 3 servers face off against eachother over 4 maps.This is basically a teamed open world PvP gamemode. You have to control as many towers, keeps, supply camps as you can over the span of the 4 maps. The more you control, the more points you get. You basically want to win your match\\-ups for ... honor.Just like in PvP you can also activate reward tracks for extra loot. Killing players and NPCs in WvW will of course also get you loot, but seeing as there are less NPCs to kill and more players \\(which is harder\\) you won't necessarily gain loot as fast as in PvE.There's usually a commander leading the map. This is a person with a blue Dorito above his head who's either leading 49 other people off of a cliff or leading them to capture a keep or fight another commander.\n",

      "Seeing as the game modes already took quite a write\\-up I'll try to emphasize other selling points and keep it as short as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fashion Wars**:\n",
      "   * Collecting armor &amp; skins can also be a huge timesink if that's what you like. There's plenty of armor, weapon &amp; backpack skins to collect as well as armor dyes for extra crispy dye combination.\n",
      "* **Miniatures**:\n",
      "   * Kind of like pets but completely useless, you can have 1 mini running behind you. These are also collectable &amp; some main characters have a mini. So you could have anything from spiders, cats, raid bosses or important NPCs in the form of a mini.\n",
      "* **Seasonal events**:\n",
      "   * During Winter for example there's the wintersday event, Halloween there's The Mad King who usually pays a visit and in April there's Super Adventure Box \\(this one is *really* loved by the community\\). They appear every year and add extra content spread over the world of Guild Wars 2. They add extra achievements and collectables during that time.\n",
      "* **The community**:\n",
      "   * Is just amazing and very welcoming. Just check r/Guildwars2 and find out for yourself.There's been an influx of new players \\(due to the Bless online fiasco\\) so it's also a good time to get started! Also due to **megaservers** no map will ever be empty and starter maps usually have veterans running around helping other people.Via the group\\-finder you can also find parties who're doing certain events on a certain map.\n",
      "* **Combat**:\n",
      "   * The combat is dynamic \\(dodge\\-rolling \\+ underwater combat\\) and engaging \\(especially in harder fractals / raids\\).You get 5 skills per weapon / weapon combination.Every 2 handed weapon gets 1 set of 5 skills \\(differs per class of course\\)&amp; every mainhand weapon gets 3 and the off\\-hand weapon gets 2 skills.You get 1 healing skill \\(slot 6\\) &amp; 3 utility skills \\(you can swap these\\) and finally an elite skill \\(can also swap between multiple elites\\).

      "Believe it or not, this is happening right now. Last night I was eating chicken wings. I swallowed, and felt a sharp, stabbing pain run down the side of my throat. Not like normal food got stuck in my throat pain, but more like a searing pain as if a sharp knife had just been plunged through the side of my neck. I came home, and after playing video games for a bit, went to bed. When I woke up this morning, the pain was much worse than it had been last night.

      "This happened a few months ago, but it still makes me a bit bitter. So there was a girl at my school who died in a car crash. She was a good person, smart, but I didn't know her. I had never talked to her, never sat in a group with her, etc. Not because I didn't like her, but because I'm not a social person. We had one class together before she died. I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, when they told us at the beginning of the day that she had died, I didn't recognize the name. It wasn't until I got to that class that I learned who it was. So basically we sit there for the entire hour, I say a silent prayer out of respect for her, but I mostly just stare at my desk. Later in the day, I start to get some hate from other people in that class, because I was the only one who didn't cry. They said stuff about how I was heartless and need to be more respectful to the dead. I never knew her, I shouldn't be forced to cry over her death. Very few people in that class had reason to cry over her death, because she hadn't been very social. Two days later everybody was fine except for her actual friends. Everybody else was just being fake, and they all knew it. They pretended to grieve because that's what everybody else was doing. It makes me sick.\n",

      "*No,* he swiftly realized. *This is only a part of it.* \n",
      "\n",
      "Octavian was manipulating him, just like he had done to so many others. The long-standing Commander was determined to remain on the show no matter the consequences. \n",

      "*Not this time. The writers have spoken. Octavian will die at my hand.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle had traveled the path to King Ender’s castle only once before, as a foot soldier in the failed assault of season three. It had been the closest King George had ever come to victory, advancing into King Ender’s territory after unveiling a brilliant new battle tactic. Octavian had led a valiant charge from Ender’s castle during the night which had caught King George’s troops by *surprise*. \n",
      "\n",
      "It had been one of the most extensive battles in the history of the show, leaving hundreds *dead* on either side. The producers had been forced to feed massive burial pyres for nearly a week to maintain the illusion of the war. Even now, Kyle still wondered what fuel they had used to keep them going. Miranda had advised him not to question such things.  \n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean by that?” Kyle asked a moment later. \n",
      "\n",
      "Octavian produced a stack of paper from inside his bag and waved it mockingly in front of the bars of Kyle’s mobile prison. “There’s been a change to the script.”\n",

      "*Of course. I’ll bet I’m the one who has to die now.*\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one told me.” Kyle kept his voice level. Once, his tone would have betrayed his inner turmoil, but after a few years playing the Commander he could manage the feat. Until he understood the other man’s plan, it would be best to play along. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s because the writers couldn’t afford to let everyone know the truth,” Octavian explained as the path began to wind into the mountains. “I didn’t even believe it myself at first.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle eyed the *soldier* skeptically. “The truth?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve entered the final season of the show. This storyline will end the war once and for all. Obviously, I’d let you see the script if I could, but you’ll have to believe my word for now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle was thankful for the darkness to hide his shocked expression. The end of the show? Did Octavian honestly expect him to believe that? \n",
      "\n",
      "“Explain yourself.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure you noticed that this storyline is out of the ordinary,” Octavian went on in his smooth voice. “We’ve only come to this point because King Ender has forced the writers’ hand. Truthfully, it was only a matter of time before one of them grew tired of the endless war. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, King Ender ordered me to push on after our latest victory, no matter the costs. Even after I told him King George had sent reinforcements and held the advantageous ground, he wouldn’t change his mind. This imprisonment storyline was the writers’ way to temporarily placate him. It was only in rewrites that they realized the real opportunity at hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your … *ascent*, I’m guessing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly. The writers have decided to kill off King Ender and install me in his place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle’s jaw dropped. It was even worse than he thought. Octavian hadn’t just talked the writers into allowing him to survive their looming battle, he had somehow convinced them to make him King. It was a storyline that would never work…\n",
      "\n",
      "*It can’t be the writers*, Kyle realized. *This is all Octavian. He’s gone completely insane. I can’t let him succeed.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyle had always believed the show would eventually end, but he would not let Octavian end it prematurely. He would not let the selfish man restart the war that had nearly ended the world just because he couldn’t stand to have his character written off!\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a deep breath, Kyle calmed himself. He had to hear out the *new* script to understand how he could save the show. “What do I have to do?” \n",

      "Octavian hesitated. “You … actually believe me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” Kyle nodded, “I know you speak with the writers. That’s the only way you could have survived this long, right? It makes sense that they would want this twist to remain a surprise. It will change everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly,” Octavian replied, once again the pinnacle of confidence. A lesser actor probably wouldn’t have noticed his slight hesitation the moment before. \n",
      "\n",
      "“So, what do I need to do?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“The beginning of the scene is unchanged,” Octavian explained, “You’ll still be imprisoned, and you’ll still be freed by one of King George’s *spies* within the castle. Only now, instead of trying to escape, you will confront the King…”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Octavian explained his self-created rise to power, Kyle rested his bound hands atop the knife he had taken from the set. He would not let Octavian end the show before its time. It was his duty to maintain the peace for as long as possible. \n",

Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500 per month \\($30k per year\\) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not the holy Trinity method, but consider these three factors that give us flexibility: a 3&amp;#37; withdrawal rate is below the 100&amp;#37; historically safe mark of 3.2&amp;#37; for fifty\\-year portfolio survival, the extended bull market peaked us nearly 20&amp;#37; above the original target amount \\(meaning that $30k annually is actually 2.5&amp;#37; instead of 3&amp;#37; if restarting from the peak\\); and our actual withdrawal rate was averaging less than 2&amp;#37; of the original portfolio balance \\(due to earning additional income\\) when we received an unexpected $30k windfall \\(meaning that our current withdrawal rate is actually negative\\).

We generated $1039 of income this month from my wife wanting to work and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was $960 this month, thus our pro\\-rated, annually\\-adjusted withdrawal rate is 1.04&amp;#37; for the month, \\-5.16&amp;#37; for the year, and \\-0.76&amp;#37; since retirement.

      "**\\*\\*Investments\\*\\***: The portfolio went from $1,130,151 to $1,147,124 \\(a 1.50&amp;#37; increase for the month\\), which went down to a new total of \\(drum\\-roll\\) $1,146,164 after cashing the checks and paying the bills. This is a 11.73&amp;#37; increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full\\-time employee generating $53.14/hr of labor income. To sustain the original portfolio balance, $17.59/hr is the pace needed for COL based on spending rate; $\\-4.75/hr is the pace needed for COL based on withdrawal rate.

The agency also is making plans to establish a \"Strategic Electric Generation Reserve\" with the aim of promoting the national defense and maximizing domestic energy supplies.\n",

      "&gt; Trump administration officials have contemplated action for more than a year. After the Energy Department conducted a reliability study last year, Energy Secretary Rick Perry proposed a rule that would have compensated coal and nuclear plants for their ability to store months’ worth of fuel on site. Federal regulators shot down the idea in January.\n",

      "&gt; That didn’t quell requests for help. A FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary requested immediate intervention from Perry’s agency in late March. That plea followed the Akron, Ohio-based company’s announcement to shut three nuclear power plants that feed the grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, the largest in the country. FirstEnergy Solutions filed for bankruptcy within days of its emergency request.\n",

Our mods jumped into the discussion and the idea was briefly entertained. Let me reiterate that this was AFTER the original fake orders were sent. Here is the breakdown of what happened in our discord to be as transparent as possible.\n",

      "[3:22 PM Eastern](https://imgur.com/vBDkP18): More of our general members suggesting a different idea to send fake orders to enemies that attempt to visit our order website. One of our mods responded to this idea stating that we have entertained the idea of giving enemies fake orders to OUR strategies. Once again this all just shows that these conversations were all hypothetical and our users were just spit-balling ideas. At no point in time was there a statement of \"Let's make fake orders\" and a mod said \"Yeah! That's a great idea. Let's do that ASAP\"\n",

Unfortunately, we don't have that information, but if anyone else does please feel free to share. Also if the mods of /r/cfbrisk could share the time that the blacklist occurred it would help to clarify the situation.\n",

      "\n",
      "/u/jimjip is an alt account that that created a chaos subreddit (/r/cfbrisk_chaos) four days ago to mass PM users chaos orders. If you remember back to four days ago, that was when Chaos was completely trapped in Florida and on the brink of potential elimination. Michigan would clearly have no motive to increase Chaos participation and hurt our largest ally. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were aware of /u/jimjip a few days ago and the first few comments on the account were on /r/cfb and were very obviously made to seem like a Michigan fan.

      "Here is a screenshot of the [orders](https://imgur.com/s7bgHzS) /u/jimjip sent in case the comments get deleted. Note that these comments have the same exact format as /u/testrail who created daily posts sending out orders for Ohio State. His orders can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/kxRkWNY) just in case they get deleted. Obviously it wouldn't be hard to generate a bot to mimic orders of other teams. But I would urge you to think what motivation Michigan would have to create fake chaos orders four days ago to increase Chaos participation when our largest ally had Chaos on the ropes? From our perspective, that seems like something a red team would have motivation for, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "So on one hand there is evidence of our discord discussing the idea of fake orders after one of our users received a fake order himself and seemingly after the site wide blacklist occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand there is definitive proof that an account was made 3 days ago to increase chaos participation when chaos was trapped in Florida and on the brink of elimination. Furthermore, those chaos orders were in the format of OSU's PM's by /u/testrail. Meanwhile, the [orders](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444518362614202370/451827465938272270/image.png) from yesterday were in the format of Nebraska's PMs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously Michigan could've manipulated the PM's to mimic OSU and Nebraska. The format of the orders isn't close to proof of anything. But, as I mentioned above, it doesn't make sense for Michigan to generate orders 4 days ago to increase chaos participation against Florida. Nor does it make sense to generate orders for chaos to attack \"Alabama Territory\" yesterday when those Alabama territories was Texas' best bet of escaping the reds and making it back to the Blue's front lines. \n",

      "**Disclaimer**:\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not make this post to point fingers or start a shitting match of who did what. I'm not blaming the mods of Nebraska or OSU for generating these orders.

      "I know Barry and iris were always end game but hear me out. Barry's short-lived relationship with patty was probably the happiest we've seen his character despite everything going on with zoom. Patty brought out a more light hearted and fun Barry and they had more chemistry on that one \"blind\" date than him and iris have this entire show... Barry and Patty shared the same interests and the same burdens (having both lost a parent/parents) and I feel like the relationship between iris and Barry is more \"let's bond over crises rather than mutual interests\" and \"we seem to be together across time and space so let's just be together here and now\" \n",

I also have a dog (border collie) but she stays in my room for most of the day bc I’m only ever gone for a few hours at a time.

I have tried a lot of things including concentrated citrus oil, coffee grounds, black pepper, and even predator piss (I am that desperate) to dissuade the cat from visiting my backyard, but nothing has worked.

      "\n",
      "&gt; *\"Why is the Harry Potter fandom starting to turn against JK Rowling?\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a question that has been especially asked as-of late in the online fan community, and I wanted to give my personal view and input, as a longtime Harry Potter fan myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply put, I think it is primarily because J.K. Rowling’s views, since first writing the series, have changed, especially after she has published the books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, her attitude as to her “ownership”, and the future direction of, Harry Potter vastly differs from the views of many Harry Potter fans, especially those fans who express their opinions online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, in a nutshell, I’ll title this answer **“J.K. Rowling vs. the Internet”**.\n",
      "\n",
      "-------\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Times have vastly changed since J.K. Rowling first outlined, planned, and began writing the Harry Potter books in the 1990’s. \n",
      "\n",
      "While most of her readership were children born, and growing up, in the 1990’s and 2000’s, and with the Internet as an increasingly important staple of the modern Western household and culture, J.K. Rowling did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Rowling herself grew up as a member of Generation X (b. 1965), and as of the writing of this article, is 52 years old. Thus, she, and her views, fit more in-line with most Harry Potter fans’ parents, as opposed to the fans themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to this, there also appears to be an ever-widening generational gap between Rowling herself, and the majority of younger Harry Potter fans, the latter of whom are largely a part of the Milennial Generation. Rowling, up until recently, has proven to be more conservative than many of her fans on certain views, particularly on copyright issues, expressing her “ownership” over Harry Potter, and “fan works”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most notable examples of this are, in chronological order...\n",
      "\n",
      "------\n",
      "\n",
      "**1995–1997 - The Internet begins to build global roots. The first Harry Potter book, \"Harry Potter and the Philospher’s Stone\", is released.**\n",
      "\n",
      "While J.K. Rowling was penning Harry Potter, the Internet was still in its infancy. At first, due to this, Rowling, unable to afford a computer - much less Internet - wrote and did her outlines for the books on “napkins” and pieces of printer paper at a local establishment in her area, the Elephant House.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1995, only 0.4% of the world population, or 16 million users, had access to the the Internet; by the release of the first Harry Potter book in 1997, that number had risen to 1.7%, or 70 million users.\n",
      "\n",
      "As not many people had the Internet, Harry Potter first gained fame through “word of mouth” among reading and educational circles by publishers Bloomsbury (UK) and Scholastic (US), and was first promoted, and would later be come to seen for years to come, as a “children’s book”.\n",
      "\n",
      "-----\n",
      "\n",
      "**1997 - 2004 - The Internet spreads rapidly on a global scale, ballooning from being used by 1.7% of the global population (70 million users) , to 12.7 % (~1 billion users).** By 2002, the first social media website, Friendster, also appears online, garnering 3 million users by 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2003, both MySpace and LinkedIn launch online, beginning the rise of social media on the Internet. Online chat rooms are also popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Included in the spread of “Internet culture”, and during the adolescence of social media, is the founding of several Harry Potter online communities for fans, including websites like SugarQuill, MuggleNet, the Leaky Cauldron, the Harry Potter Lexicon, Fanfiction.net, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Harry Potter becomes increasingly popular in mainstream culture as more books and films are released, transforming from a mere “children’s book series” into a “pop culture phenomenon”. For books, \"Chamber of Secrets\" is released in 1998; \"Prisoner of Azkaban\", in 1999; \"Goblet of Fire\", in 2000; and \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" in 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Internet is increasingly integrated into Western schools, and J.K. Rowling conducting online “chat room interviews” with school-children, Harry Potter fan fiction and discussion begins to appear - and spread rapidly - online, quickly dwarfing other book communities.\n",
      "\n",

Only 4 years earlier, in 2004, the first legal same-sex marriage in the United States had taken place in Massachusetts.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, even in the given climate at the time, Rowling’s announcement was met with plenty of controversy - and some because gay marriage was not yet legal in the United States. Likewise, there were some rumours of Warner Brothers, the makers of the Harry Potter films, quietly “silencing” their LGBTQA+ actors from the films, for the purpose of “preserving their public image”.\n",

      "This included the creation of “clickbait” titles in order to gain more traffic, which many fans greatly disliked, not just because the articles were misleading - promising new information, when, in reality, there was none - but also due to the poorly-written quality of many of the “articles”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many fans also criticized the website’s poor search function and formatting, which made it difficult to navigate the site, and to locate specific articles. The website’s branding of “the digital heart of the wizarding world” also greatly rankled fans, who expected much more than what the site actually provided.\n",

      "This one is fairly self-explanatory. \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", which was later revealed to be largely “ghostwritten” for Rowling on the part of Thorne and Tiffany, received an enourmous amount of backlash and negative criticism from Harry Potter fans and the online community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main reason for fan backlash? Not only was the work widely regarded as “unfaithful”, and wildly inconsistent, with how most fans popularly viewed the original Harry Potter books - and for good reason - but it was later admitted by Thorne that he had based a large part of the story “off of his own personality and experiences”, practically imposing his own life over that of Harry Potter, the main character, in the play.\n",
      "\n",
      "To many fans, because J.K. Rowling chose not to solely write the script herself, and allowed Thorne and Tiffany to have what they saw as “too much creative control”, this served to further sour the once-rosy view that many fans held of Rowling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, Rowling herself, who had previously been documented by fans as liking “black Hermione” or “race-bent Hermione” art shared from Tumblr on her official Twitter account, agreed on the casting of a black actress, Noma Dumezweni, as Hermione Granger in the on-stage production of Cursed Child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, this decision - and Rowling’s later defense of it - proved to be extremely controversial amongst fans, many of whom “always saw Hermione as white”.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on what I’ve personally seen, in my experience with the online Harry Potter fan community, the most recent examples of Pottermore (“A History of Magic in North America”) and \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" merely brought to light a dispute between Rowling and her fans that had been brewing for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Namely, the dispute is thus: “Who ‘owns’ Harry Potter, as a franchise, and its future direction? J.K. Rowling, the original author who wrote the series, and continues to write content…or the Harry Potter fans, who support the franchise with their money?”\n",
      "\n",
      "From the timeline provided above, the process of divergence has been one years in the making, taking over a decade to come to an impasse between author and fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the original Harry Potter fans “growing up” and maturing, so, too, have they increasingly come to view Harry Potter not as a “children’s book series”, but as an “adult one”, too. Meanwhile, Rowling still largely sees the original Harry Potter books as “for children”, seeking to write more “adult” themes into the spin-off Fantastic Beasts film franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "To revisit the “generational gap” as well, it’s clear that J.K. Rowling, who grew up in a more “conservative” time, has vastly different views of Harry Potter than Milennial fans do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary reason for this? Technology. Specifically, the rise of the Internet and social media in modern society. As opposed to the time Rowling grew up in, Milennial Harry Potter fans are now much greater in number and vocal ability, thanks to growing up using (and forming communities on) the Internet.\n",

      "I am sure that this was already mentioned in comments but I've seen many topics opened in the last hours about slow connection issues and the region change could be a huge factor in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the game uses p2p connection one of the most important factor for the connection strength and quality is the physical distance between the 2 players. When I was paired with players with my country (according to their nickname) the connection was always really strong. Keep in mind that even if you play your own region other players can join against you from other regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also it's worth to clarify since it is not clear to many of us that in case of p2p connection usually the experience is more or less the same in both sides. So someone with \"poor\" connection won't have better chance against you since you'll be just as laggy to them as they are to you. Your opponent sees the same connection strength icon as you. Of course this also depends on many factors (and it sadly gives some room to cheating with special tools) so it is not always true, but generally this is the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to note to avoid the \"why p2p\" discussion: in case of 1v1/2v2 games (like for example fighting games) p2p is the best way to play multiplayer since the data don't have to travel to a server and then back to players. When more and more players play the same game and have to communicate with each other a centralized, server based solution gets better and better. As a rule of thumb when 5+ players are connected in a single game then a well placed, fast server is considered as a better solution than p2p but this again depends on many factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "edit: p2p means peer2peer in this case. So the gaming clients are connected directly to each other, there isn't a dedicated server between them.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Wish the camera was static when receiving the serve\n",
      "\n",
      "- Wish we could communicate some emotions (at least) to the opponent. Some games were legit tight! I wanted to congratulate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The more you go up the ladder in the tournament, the more it might take time to find an opponent (for now)\n",

I generally walk pretty fast but this guy was outpacing me so i tried to keep up by walking immediately behind him to minimise air resistance. After walking like that for a while he noticed and asked me why i was walking so close behind him and i told him i was drafting. He just went \"oh ok\" and kept on going. After even more he arrived at an office building and was greeted by a stacy who asked me who i was. Chad said i was just drafting as i said thank you and kept walking.

Combined, that’s 56 total units. So from 253 heroes entering, we will be going down to 197 in a single day.  Will some popular units see their downfall on day one? Or will it be all units with small fanbases?  Either way, you decide.\n",

      "Get a wired connection. Seriously, I know people will go \"I can play Mario Kart with wifi fine\" but that's because Mario Kart has always been programmed differently to compensate for lag. This isn't possible in Smash Brothers and high action games like Mario Tennis Aces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a device you can use that I personally use on the Switch for a wired connection that works flawlessly. (No referral, just the link to it if you want to purchase it) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MYTSN18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\n",
      "\n",
      "The #1 thing about a Wired Connection IS NOT about faster speeds. It's about stability. There is no stability when you are on wifi. It is why if you call your ISP about your wifi being dumb, they will tell you there are several reasons it can be doing that which is out of their control, which is true. This is about CONTROLLING YOUR PING. Your ping should not move at all on a wired connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you INSIST you can't use a wired connection due to house setup.. Get as close to your router as you can. Make there be as few walls between you and the router as possible. You'll want to make sure people aren't video streaming at all when you try to online game with wifi though. Netflix/Hulu/Twitch will likely kill your online gaming experience otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "De-activate devices you arent using on wifi. The more devices you have connected to a wifi network the more likely there can be issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something specifically related to Mario Aces: Understand the connection rating IS WHAT YOU BOTH SEE. If you're accepting a 2/5 match, that means that is what the connection is for both of you. If you are never capable of getting 4/5 or 5/5 matches.. That means your setup effectively isn't capable of getting that because you should be able to get that sometimes if you have a good connection. Peer to Peer it only takes one person to be able to ruin the connections ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Smash coming and Tennis being playable now, along with games like Fortnite and Dragon Ball FighterZ seemingly coming, you should really start to invest in that wired connection though. Again, it isn't about speeds, wifi can get fine speeds. It's about CONTROLLING YOUR PING.\n",

      "Its been almost a week since the new Dark Souls Remaster came out, and feels like the game hype die off really fast, but most importantly somehow I feel the Switch Edition being pushed back really impacted the game release hype overall, I am still buying the game when is ready, but they really lost an incredible release window for the game, as the E3 rumors indicate that the incoming months will be packed with great games that could easily overshadow/compete heavily with Dark Souls.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, on Wed 5/29 Trumps tweet contained the unexpectedly capitalized letters: NTDEMRWH. \\(Don't use any PROPERLY capitalized words.\\) My interpretation: New Tariff Declarations Effective Midnight thuRsday Will Happen. Sure enough, the next day \\- 5/30 new tariffs were announced effective Thursday at midnight! Granted I had only part of it worked out before the actual announcement, so I did have the help of hindsight a bit on that one. But it seems that only validates that the future proves the past in that tweet!\n",

      "Cut to a week later, we are having a phone meeting with her and she emails me THE PLAN. It's many many pages basically explaining what we have vs. what we will need if we want to retire.  But she mostly just talks about how we need more life insurance. \"Sure\" we think. Maybe we do need more life insurance. She explains that husband needs at least $1mill in life insurance and I need $500k (we both already have $150k policies through work on ourselves). This is news to us but we hear her out. She also spends a ton of time explaining how we need to have disability insurance. Again, we think \"maybe we do\". So we spend the greater part of an hour and a half talking about life insurance and long term disability insurance. She briefly mentions we should be maxing out my Roth IRA and we could perhaps start one for husband. So we hang up, with plans to talk again in a week and sign some paperwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next week, husband and I really realize that we don't want disability insurance (she quoted us paying like $170/month) and we didn't really feel we needed more life insurance at this time (she had us paying $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term). But we were ok maxing out my Roth at $450/month. We also wanted to explore stocks/bonds/CD's/mutual funds more (like we initially told her). So I sent this all to her in an email before our next meeting. She sends back \"OK, great! Sounds good.. talk soon\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut to another phone meeting, where she would talk with us about our updated PLAN. She emails us the NEW PLAN while we are on the phone. LITERALLY NOTHING IS CHANGED. She proceeds to spend the next hour convincing us why we need life insurance and disability insurance. Husband and I are both pushovers and listen to the whole schpeel again. Every time we bring up a reason why we don't feel like we need it, she tells us how we are wrong. I mean, she's the professional, we thought. I still expressed my disinterest in disability insurance but wasn't completely closing the door on life insurance. She kept giving me the guilt trip on \"what will your kids have if one of you dies!\". By the end of the conversation, I hadn't agreed to anything except to roll over my Roth to Northwestern. She had me give her my bank routing info to get \"the paperwork started\". She also said she was going to be sending me a bunch of stuff to sign in the next few weeks, but it was just to apply for things... nothing was set in stone. We could just see what the insurance company was going to quote us at, and we still aren't committed to anything. \"Ugh fine\" I think. She says a small amount might be taken out of my checking, but its just to make sure \"the charges are able to go through when we start moving more money to my Roth\".\n",
      "\n",
      "SO a week or two goes by. And I see a ~$30 charge go through for \"disability insurance\". WHICH I TOLD HER I DIDN'T WANT!! And I just realize... this doesn't feel good. It doesn't seem right. She's not listening to what we want. She still hasn't addressed out interest in CD/mutual funds/stocks that we initially came to her for. I spend the weekend doing my due diligence- spending a few hours on r/personalfinance, NerdWallet, just googling in general about what husband and I should really be doing. I decide to call the whole thing off with Northwestern.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been a nightmare trying to cut off ties with her. I was kind and courteous through the first couple emails and subsequent texts \"We really appreciate your time but have decided to pull out. Again, thank you\". \n",
      "\n",
      "She is being evasive and manipulative. Telling us we are completely wrong and we still need to work with her. At this point I have just ignored any further communication. It has just been a really bad experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But THE REAL REASON I still feel like I can't completely ignore her, is that I asked her several times when I should expect to see a refund for the disability insurance THAT I DID NOT WANT AND DID NOT AGREE TO. She just dances around the question. I'm also worried because I have gotten a \"bill\" (no charges yet) in the mail for the $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term and $170 in short term disability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything I can do to make sure I don't get charged this? If I communicate with her any farther, she just tries to talk to us about why we need to invest with her, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT DO WE DO. She is being shady AF.  \n",

      "Years ago, I'd say over half a decade, I got on the subway at rush hour to head home after a long day of classes. I was exhausted, too. There are periods in my life where I can't sleep.

      "So, there I was, crushed tight in this train, everyone rubbing against each other side-by-side so we all fit in. Naturally, like any polite person, I'd taken off my bag and held it with a hand between my legs to ensure I wasn't taking up too much space. I'm spacing out -- on top of the lack of sleep I was one of those idiots who had the \"great idea\" to have a four day weekend and scheduled all my classes on two days meaning I'd just had 9 hours straight of dull lectures -- but I notice out of the corner of my eye the guy standing to my right keeps glancing at me. I don't think much of it, but he keeps doing it throughout the 10 minutes I'm riding the train.\n",

      "Over here on /r/batman, we want as many people to enjoy Batman in any form they want to, be it comics, movies, games, animated or whatever you enjoy. Because of that, we [do have a recommended reading section on our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations), with sections for new readers, essential stories or sagas, or for particular characters, though if you just wanted a more compact list of what is the best first choices to make, here is a place for that. When making your first choice, or in reading comics in general, it really depends on what about Batman you want to read. I'm going to follow with long descriptions of many of the great Batman starting points, but if there is a particular story you have heard and are interested in, or a type or genre of story that already interests you, maybe you can ask around on the subreddit or message me, and someone should be able to help you find something close to what you may like, otherwise, the list I provide is also full of great reads. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, with Batman, although it takes the form of a continuum of comics, it doesn't really need to be read in chronological order, despite what others may try to convince you of. As a new reader, it is easy to read Batman in trade paper back format, that is, all chapters of a given story collected in the one book. In this form, any chronology or history needed to be known of Batman is given in that story, and you can read these stories as one off events or standalone stories, so long as you have a general idea of what Batman characters there are and what they represent, though even new characters can make a great surprise. There are multiple jumping on points, so I will describe a few, and if one takes your interest, pick it up and start reading, because that is the best way to get into Batman, to just pick something up and start reading, getting to know what type of stories you like, what writers or artists, plots or characters, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, most of the really old stuff no one will really recommend, this makes up what is often known as the Gold, Silver and Bronze ages. In the late 80's, there was an event called Crisis on Infinite Earths, which I'm not recommending, though you may see fans refer to the stretch of comics written between the late 80's and 2011 as the \"Post-Crisis Era\". This Era has many beloved stories that many fans will recommend, and is easy enough to jump into.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before that though, a fan favourite comic called **The Dark Knight Returns** (by Frank Miller) was written that is loved by many fans and even writers themselves, inspiring most of what even the modern Batman represents. It is a standalone story of an old Batman in a dystopic future/80's Gotham, though having a very good understanding of what Batman represents is kind of needed to understand why the comic works so well. I wouldn't necessarily read it first of these suggestions, but it is written before anything else I will recommend, and it is good to keep in mind for later reading as it is such a classic. (It has also heavily inspired many films, such as Nolan's films, BvS and even some of the Arkham games, if this interests you)\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is the jumping on point for the start of the Post Crisis Era. Frank Miller also got to write the post-crisis origin of Batman in **Batman: Year One**, which is also a really great character story for Batman, Gordon and a solid hero's origin story, of a very early career Batman and Gordon taking on low level crime, which is written excellently. You don't need to start reading Batman comics from issue one and continue reading chronologically to enjoy Batman, though if this type of story interests you, you may want to pick it up. (This serves as the primary influence for Batman Begins, if this interests you).\n",
      "\n",
      "My next recommendation is also a great starting point, that of **Batman: The Long Halloween** (by Jeph Loeb), though also works as a solid continuation of Year One (though don't feel too constrained by chronology, each work as great stand alone stories). TLH is heralded by many Batman fans as one of the great Batman mystery stories, still featuring an early career Batman to start as a good jumping in point, though starting to have Batman approach more Super crime in his stories. As great as TLH is on its own though, it also has a sequel that is even better (though depends heavily on having read TLH first) called **Batman: Dark Victory**, for future reference if this story interests you. (These also serve as big influences on The Dark Knight, if this interests you).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also present are starting points for other members of the Batfamily. **Batgirl/Robin: Year One** (a trade paper back collecting both of these individual stories, by Chuck Dicon and Scott Beatty) makes for a great entry point for readers looking to explore the dynamics of the Batfamily, beginning with cornerstones of the family. Following up from Dark Victory, Robin: Year One covers the first year of Dick Grayson's time as a superhero, examining the complex father-son relationship between Batman and Robin, and acknowledging the dangers of having a child sidekick. Batgirl: Year One tells the story of how Barbara Gordon was motivated to become a crimefighter while breaking down social prejudices, while seeding her relationships with various heroes, including her friendship (and later romance) with Dick. For recommended readings of other Batfamily members, or other DC characters for that matter, check out the excellent [recommended reading lists](https://old.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/recommended) available form /r/DCcomics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up, **Batman: The Killing Joke** (by Alan Moore) is also easy first readings for a new Batman fan, a stand alone story featuring one of Batman's greatest and most influential confrontations with the Joker. This is the comic that lead to Batman comics becoming dark, and has about as much influence as TDKR has had on the comics industry (both came out at roughly the same time), and once again, a broad understanding of what makes Batman Batman, what makes the Joker the Joker, and an understanding of their history of confrontations is suggested before reading, as this story really encapsulates all of that, though also serves as an easy enough stand alone story. (This story is a huge influence on Batman '89, The Dark Knight, the Arkham games, and was adapted in 2016 into an animated movie, that wasn't really as good, so definitely read and don't watch this one.)\n",
      "\n",
      "After all of this, Batman stories start getting convoluted, continuity heavy, and not all that good, until in the mid 2000's when **Batman: Hush** came out (also by Jeph Loeb, who wrote TLH), a new starting point for readers with a mid career Batman, once again solving a great Batman mystery and with one of comics greatest artists Jim Lee, featuring many of Batman's most well known allies and villains, this is the comic that got people into reading Batman comics again after the 90's. If you're worried about timelines at all though, don't feel too concerned, as it was the first Batman comic I ever read and I was never confused, and is I feel a great recommendation for new readers, encapsulating many great moments of mystery, action and a wide span of well known characters that it has a lot for every fan. After this though, it becomes a little harder to recommend starting on points for what is a late career, post-crisis Batman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further down the timeline from this is two well known runs, that of [Morrison's](https://i.imgur.com/5o92qw1.png) and [Dini's](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/sagas#wiki_batman.2C_by_paul_dini), and although these runs are great stuff, they are better for more experienced readers, as they require a bit more investment in Batman's timeline and history to be able to appreciate, though keep these comics in mind for later reading once you'e got hooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2011, an event called Flashpoint happened (which I'm not necessarily recommending here), that reset the DC comics universe. Many new fans shy away from things like reboots, but it actually makes reading comics easier, by providing easier jumping on points and cutting away a lot of unnecessary history and continuity. The in-universe mechanics of how a reboot happened are not really that important though, but the next \"Era\" of comics is known as the New 52 universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New 52 Batman series is also a really great set of Batman comics (only 10 volumes in this run, and all of really great quality) that's great for new readers. Start with Scott Snyder's **Batman: The Court of Owls** (volume 1), one of the great modern detective/mystery Batman stories, which can be followed up with **Batman: The City of Owls** (volume 2, and needed to finish off that story), which can then be continued in volume order (volume 3 is **Batman: Death of the Family**, another of the greatest Batman vs Joker encounters (different, and much better than A Death in the Family, because comics and comic naming can be confusing), but really, all of Snyder's New 52 Batman run is great.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, a new event called \"Rebirth\" rebooted the universe again, and provided a new jumping on point if you wanted to get caught up to the Batman comics that are currently being written. Once again, volume order is simple enough to follow, starting with Tom King's **I am Gotham**, then **I am Suicide**, **I am Bane**, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes up the easiest starting points for new fans to the \"canon\" Batman stories, though there are also some really great non-canon or \"Elseworld\" stories that I will recommend, as some fans also really enjoy these, and if you don't start with them, you can always keep them in the back of your mind for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many fans seem to enjoy the **Batman: Earth One** stories (by Geoff Johns, of which there are 2 volumes) based off a more realistic Gotham, inspired by Nolan's movies. Volume 2 is much better than volume 1, though depends on having read volume 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Original Graphic Novel called \"**Joker**\" (by Brian Azzarello) tells a great Joker solo story, serving as a response to Ledger's Joker in TDK, though in comic form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, while toeing the line between canon and non-canon, **Batman: A Serious House on Serious Earth** (by Grant Morrison, whose whole work on Batman is great, as mentioned above, with the rest of his works involving a late career post-crisis Batman) is also an extraordinary Batman story, also heavily featuring the Joker, though is often off putting to new fans due to its extremely different take on visuals and panel layout, though is an excellent story, and I would recommend keeping in the back of your mind for later, as it is so excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a similar boat is **Batman: Ego** (by Darwyn Cooke, and collected in the trade paper back Batman: Ego and other Tails). It's not set in the main canon like the above titles, but is still your standard Batman, with this comic being a dissection of Batman's psyche and exploration of Bruce's perspectives on his mission as a hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this became really long, but I hope it is really helpful. Tell me if you found something you enjoy! Also, if you have any further questions, feel free to ask, either me or the subreddit, and I will be happy to answer for you! If there is a particular story you feel might interest you, you can ask me more about it. Happy reading, and I hope you have found something you enjoy!\n",

      "A business proposal is an offer presented to a client with the intention of providing services that meet that particular client’s needs. The business proposal should not be confused with a business plan. A business plan is usually a document that details a company’s strategy for meeting its financial and operational goals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Preparation: Preparation and planning is an essential part of writing a good business proposal. The time you take to prepare for the task will determine the quality of the document itself. In fact, it’s recommended that you always take more time to prepare than you take writing out the proposal itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the preparation stage, you will have to consider the audience you are writing to. Gather as much information about the client as possible so as to tailor the proposal specifically to them. Establish also the approach you will use in tackling the client's problem. Sometimes clients require that you include in your proposal what method you will use when working on their problem. This is planned for at the preparation stage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Writing the proposal: After being satisfied that you have all the information you need you can then proceed to write the proposal. The document itself has a particular structure that you should be careful to observe. These are the contents of a good business proposal:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The title: The title of the business proposal should be interesting and captivating. It basically should be a one-sentence summary of what the entire proposal is all about. Always avoid writing some boring titles for the business proposals you send out. In case you are stuck on the title, don’t worry. You can even write it last after you are done with the entire document. You may get just the right idea of a title in the process of writing. Because you are writing for a specific audience, always have in mind how the client would like the title to look like. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The executive summary: This is a brief summary of the entire document for the busy executive. It includes a presentation of all the key points of the proposal in a compelling manner that will make the executive get a good grasp of the entire document at a glance.  It should be clear, and persuasive as well. This is where the relevant information regarding the proposal is introduced. The approach to be used when solving the client’s problem is also introduced here. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Opportunity statement: This is the part of the business proposal that seeks to deal with the client’s problem in a deeper way. With the opportunity statement, you discuss the client’s need in detail and propose your solutions as well. The length and depth you go to in discussing the problem will depend on the nature of the need. There are some clients who require that you help them identify exactly what the need is, then suggest your solutions. At this point, it will be important to demonstrate to the client that you understand completely what their problem entails and have the perfect solution for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Deliverables and timelines: After you are done with the overview, you will need to specify the deliverables and timelines for the project. This has to do with what the client should expect from you and how long you will take to work on the solution. You should be careful to make everything clear at this juncture so that neither you nor the client will have unreasonable expectations. Always avoid over or under promising.  It’s important to be realistic where timelines are concerned. In case the project takes longer than you anticipated, you should be having enough time to cover for such eventualities. It will be a great idea to identify any possible areas of trouble that you may run into and inform the client so that they are ware. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Proposed budget: The budget is the most crucial part of a business proposal. It’s actually so important that some clients will read the budget first before considering any other aspect of the proposal. Because of this, you always aim at making the budget accurate, easy to understand and realistic. It’s recommended that you set a fixed price provided it’s tenable for the entire project. There’s also the option of an hourly rate of pay but this may present problems for both you and your client. It’s usually possible to set a value on your work by computing the total project expenditure. An important point to note is the need to have the budget broken down into its constituent elements. The client may find it quite hard to understand and accept a budget that comes in a lump sum without knowing the minor details about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Conclusion: The conclusion comes in to wrap everything in a nice way. Just like the introduction, a good conclusion will contribute to the overall appeal of your proposal to the client. \n",

Oh, it also may not fit through the conveyor belt system at the main facility.\n",

We thought that maybe something spilled, but then the wet spot got larger and larger until we determined it was seeping out from the baseboards.  We went through all the towels, and our neighbors towels, really quickly trying to hold back the leak.  So we got out the shop vac \\(luckily we never lost power or we'd be in trouble\\) and just set it up near that point to suck up the water as it came in.   We had to deal with a loud\\-ass shop vac all night, but it did keep the water from becoming a big problem.\n",

      "The next day we found that the water was being driven in through some stucco cracks on the wall that was facing the wind, and that water was then making it's way into our kitchen from there.

      "Before he could linger any more on that thought, the other dragons landed, shaking the earth like the fists of an angry god. One was a deep amber, color of unearthed gold, and it pawed at the snow delicately, as if it did not care for the snow between its claws. He faintly recognized its thick-bearded rider as one of the men from the cave. He patted the dragon’s neck and murmured things to it in a language that Clint couldn’t understand, even if he had been close enough to hear it.\n",

He couldn’t bear the image of that dragon deciding to shake her off midair. \n",

But up there on that great beast’s back, she looked like she had found a way outside the circles spinning in her head. “Riding dragons!” she cried back. “And reading!” She pulled her battered copy of *The Inferno* out of her shirt and waved it at him.\n",

      "Leada unfurled a rope ladder and anchored it to two of the huge spikes jutting from her dragon’s spine. She climbed down to the end of the ladder and leapt the last few feet back to the earth nimbly. “We worship Fortune,” she reminded her brother, “and so she is always in our favor, though she may reveal her hand with time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He rolled his eyes and waved her off. “There will be an army,” he said, his voice heavy as falling stones. “They will come now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And we will fight them,” said the third rider, his accent so thick Clint could hardly understand him. He had descended his dragon so quickly Clint had not quite registered it. He’d been too busy watching Daphne descend that ladder, the dragon’s immense head curved back to observe her in fascination. He gestured to Clint’s haphazard team. “And you will help.”\n",

Mostly other musicians will notice that during the part where I switch the groove to the open hats. Because I only have a very short limb, there is also a timing/latency issue when striking The Hammer with my limb to the kick head that I think is just going to get better with more practice and experience. It’s honestly like having to relearn how to play drums again. The muscle memory is there, but my body is drastically different. Going to experiment with triggers to see if that helps my situation.

      "For seventeen years, I’ve studied the best conversationalists and what they do differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the habits I discovered was that the best conversationalists don’t hide their flaws and imperfections—they embrace them. They are the first to admit their weaknesses. The path to social confidence and more interesting conversations starts with social vulnerability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about the person or people who make you feel comfortable. Likable and easy\\-going people are usually comfortable in their own skin and have embraced their character flaws. They are okay being a little vulnerable. These likable people are the first to admit that they aren’t perfect and are happy to laugh at their personal quirks. They’re quick to admit funny mistakes or episodes of forgetfulness. They use their flaws to their advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about that for a minute...\n",
      "\n",
      "The best conversationalists realize that their weaknesses and insecurities can actually make some interesting conversation material. Not many people want to listen to a braggart rave about how well he did on a test or how many new sports cars he owns. But everyone enjoys hearing about the time you made a fool of yourself at that party—especially if you can laugh about it after the fact. Your flaws subconsciously make others feel better about themselves, as well. The end result is that people will often like you *more* after you expose an inner flaw or embarrassing experience, even of the small or trivial variety.\n",

      "**Check out the following example:**\n",

      "***Nate:*** *Wow, that’s an awesome tattoo.*\n",

      "***Lisa:*** *Thanks, my husband George actually drew it.*\n",
      "\n",
      "***Nate:*** *Really? That’s cool.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a very interesting interaction, huh? Now let’s look at the conversation if Nate had admitted a weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Nate:*** *Really? I wish I could draw like that. I could probably draw a 3D cube, but that’s about it. My skills don’t get much beyond cubes—and half the time I even mess up the 3D part!*\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation took a much more interesting and playful turn because Nate admitted something he was bad at. These types of statements are also great to toss around in order to paint your self\\-portrait with a little shade of humility. Look at a few more examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "* *I never knew/experienced \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.*\n",

      "\n",
      "A few years ago, I was riding in a car with my new boss, and she asked me how to find our destination. I responded rather bluntly and with some embellishment, “I’ll be honest, I’m navigationally impaired…I’m probably the worst person to ask for directions. If I say turn ‘left,’ you’re probably better off turning right!” She quickly admitted that she, too, was horrible at navigating, and we both had a few laughs over who was worse! It was a good bonding experience.\n",

      "I've been incredibly homesick lately, and it's been so nice seeing the sudden influx of scenic Indiana photos you all have been sharing this week. I moved down south in late January \\(not sad that I missed the extreme cold\\), and although Florida is beautiful and was a welcome change, I spent 28 years \\(born and raised\\) in Indiana and I miss it more than I thought I would.

      "\n",
      "The years without my wife and son were unbearable. Time and hope seemed to pass by in tandem. With no family or friends, I grabbed two of my favorite possessions, a bottle of bourbon and my .45 caliber revolver. It was cold, rainy, and quiet— a good day to die. I took a final swig and placed the cold barrel against my sweating temple. With one final deep breath, I wrapped my finger around the trigger and…\n",
      "\n",
      "*KNOCK—KNOCK—KNOCK* \n",
      "\n",
      "I set the gun down, racking my brain as to who could be at the door. I never had visitors. Still, I feared this person could hear the gunshot, and I didn’t want anyone to be involved with my death. I had already caused enough trauma for a lifetime. I got up from my bed and slowly stumbled to the front door. To my surprise, there was no one there. Instead a bouquet of thirteen black roses and a small brown parcel sat on my doorstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I looked upon the ink-colored flowers, images of my wife’s funeral played in my drunken mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The memory of her memorial service is hazy, but there are a few details that I will never forget: the cold rain dampening my grey suit, the glaring stares of judgment from her family, the familiar sting of bourbon in the back of my throat, and the bouquet of black roses placed next to her casket. It was the first time I had ever seen black roses, and they stood out like a drop of dark paint on a white canvas. \n",
      "\n",
      "I looked down at the package again. A card placed within the black flowers asked one simple question written in red ink:\n",
      "\n",
      "*Why do we dig the graves?*\n",
      "\n",
      "To this day, I have no idea who left the ominous flowers and strange note.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life as a single parent was difficult. My wife was the one who held our small family together. And then it was just my son and I… for a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would give anything to have my boy back. I should have been keeping an eye on him the day he went missing. As usual, I was too busy slipping out of consciousness, fumbling to take another drink before my heavy eyelids shut. The police never found him—and they probably never will. He was 7 years old when he was abducted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bent down and grabbed the items from my doorstep, brought them inside, and placed them on the table. After a few moments I tore open the rain-soaked parcel. Inside was a single spool of Super 8 film. Whoever sent me the package knew me well. Collecting Super 8 was my only hobby, although I rarely spoke of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the film in one hand and my bourbon in the other, I retreated to the basement. I proceeded to dust off my old projector, hung a small sheet over a clothesline, and loaded the film. The image burst to life. A buzzing swarm of grey static was followed by a theatrical countdown: \n",
      "\n",
      "*3…2…1*\n",
      "\n",
      "The black-and-white picture was shaky, displaying rapid flashes of clouds and sky. I inched closer to get a better view of the video. The scene came into focus—a boy in a large field, covered in dirt and grime. The camera zoomed closer, and his face came into the frame. The bottle fell from my hand and shattered on the floor. The boy… was my son, Benjamin—and he was digging large hole. \n",
      "\n",
      "I gasped. I was sure it was him. Thoughts raced through my head. I felt dizzy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where was he? What was he doing? Who sent me the film? \n",
      "\n",
      "I kept watching, and in an instant, the basement exploded with sound, forcing me back in fright. \n",
      "\n",
      "A deep, grainy voice spoke: \n",
      "\n",
      "“Benjamin…” (My son stopped digging, cocked his head to the side, and stared at the camera.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Benjamin…why do we dig the graves?\n",
      "\n",
      "“To bury the dead,” my son said in a monotone voice. \n",

      "“And why do we bury the dead?” the deep voice asked.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Benjamin responded, “We bury the dead… to feed the black roses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I jumped to my feet and paced around the basement. I had to act. I had to rescue him. The voice spoke again: \n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not tell anyone. Come… alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera panned to the large hole Benjamin had been digging, then focused on the surrounding area. \n",
      "\n",
      "It hit me. I knew the building he was standing near. It was the abandoned warehouse I used to pass on the way to work. It’s a monstrous eyesore in the middle of nowhere and has been falling into disrepair for half a century. I knew where to go…I knew where my son was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I ran upstairs, nearly tripping on every stair. My mind continued to race as my nausea reached its peak. I sprinted to the bathroom and expelled the alcohol I had for breakfast. The factory…I had to go. I had to get my son back. \n",
      "\n",
      "I dressed as quickly as I could: grabbing my coat, forcing on my boots, and tucking the pistol in my waistband. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started my truck and hit the road. \n",
      "\n",
      "The drive was eerily quiet, as if the earth had stopped turning. Dark overcast flooded the world around me in a dreary atmosphere, void of light and warmth. Twenty minutes into my drive, I realized I had not seen another person, or even another vehicle. I was alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "This solitude continued throughout the entire trip. Eventually, the factory came into view. It’s dark, red brick cut through the horizon. I parked my truck and marched through the vast field of dirt towards the building—carefully avoiding the sporadic, rectangular graves scattered across the grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon crossing the large, broken, iron-gated threshold, I crept towards the entrance of the abandoned factory. My footsteps making the only noise in an otherwise silent world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The massive front door creaked open. I inhaled deeply and stepped inside. It was enormous—concrete walls and steel beams towered above me for miles. The floor was an endless sea of broken brick, metal, and dust. The skeleton of an old assembly line sat motionless in the center of the main room. I clicked on my flashlight and began my search, unsure of where to start. \n",
      "\n",
      "I walked the halls for what seemed like hours, frantically opening doors—only to find more dust and darkness. I was ready to give up. I decided I would head home, turn the film reel into the police, and drink this all away. I walked back to where I had entered the facility.  When I finally reached it, I stood in disbelief. \n",
      "\n",
      "The door was gone. It had been replaced by a solid concrete wall. I pushed against it with all my strength. \n",
      "\n",
      "How was this possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "An explosion of noise and flashing light filled the entire factory. I spun around and drew the revolver from my waistband. The assembly line sprung to life with the loud grinding of gears.\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked forward to investigate. Piles of twisted metal and glass traveled down the line and into the next room. An aroma filled the air, smelling of oil and gasoline.  I studied the contents, quickly discovering that they were automotive parts— horribly dented and broken. After a few moments the factory lights went out with a flash, and the assembly halted.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I walked into the next room to see where the belt ended. I pushed open the double doors and walked inside. I pointed my flashlight towards a massive, dark object in the middle of the room. As soon as I saw what it was, I vomited. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a car, my wife’s car. \n",
      "\n",
      "The memory of the night she died flooded my mind. I was drinking, always drinking. The sound of wind and snow whistled loudly outside. Benjamin was upstairs in his room, bedridden from a flu that had been going around his school. My wife had just gotten home from work, disgusted at the state I had drunken myself into. She sighed as she looked me up and down, “Well, since you clearly can’t drive, I guess *I’ll* go get some medicine for *our* son.” She slammed the door as she left. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the last thing I remember from that evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, I was filling out paperwork at the police station. She died in the hospital a few hours after the crash. I was at home, unconscious during her final moments of life. I didn’t deserve her, and I never got the chance to say goodbye. \n",
      "\n",
      "I slowly approached the mangled remains of the sedan, shining my light through the broken windows. I crept towards the driver’s side window and peered inside. As my light illumined the inside of the vehicle, I fell back in horror. My eyes had to be lying. It wasn't possible. A human body sat in the seat, it’s forehead rest against the steering wheel. I stumbled backwards until my back met a cold, concrete wall. I slowly slumped down and buried my face into my hands. The dizziness and confusion returned. \n",
      "\n",
      "My thoughts began to race as I questioned the reality of the situation—overwhelmed with a familiar feeling of guilt. A guilt that I have felt every day since her accident. The guilt I try and drink away each day. I sat in the darkness, unsure of what to do or what to think. The room was spinning again, and the darkness washed over me as I turned off my light. I couldn’t stand to look at her car any longer. \n",
      "\n",
      "The silence of the room was broken by an unmistakable noise. A noise which I refused to believe was real.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opening of a car door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hinges screeched loudly and echoed throughout the vacant factory floor. However, it was the sound that followed which left me paralyzed with fear. Wet, crackling footsteps on the stone floor approached me. I fumbled to pick up my flashlight. The room illuminated, and I gasped, \n",
      "\n",
      "“Noo….I… it can’t” was all that I was able to stutter. It was her… or what was left of her. The tattered remains of my wife’s corpse stood before me, staring down at me with one eye, the other, an empty socket dripping with blood. She was wearing the same clothes as the night of the wreck, torn and stained. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to speak again,\n",
      "“Helen, I’m… sorr..I’m so sorry…” Warm tears ran down my face, and the flashlight shook violently in my quivering hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "The body shuffled forward, dragging a crushed foot and leaving behind a trail of dark blood. It knelt in front of me and placed a cold, skeletal hand against my cheek. The smell of rot was overwhelming. I closed my eyes tightly as I dry heaved from the putrid stench. I could feel its face a few inches from my own, my tears now an uncontrollable river. It pushed its cold, decaying face against mine and whispered broken words into my ear, \n",
      "\n",
      "*Why…do…we…dig…the…graves…?*\n",
      "\n",
      "I screamed at the top of my lungs as I fired the .45. The sound was deafening. It reverberated through the cavernous building.  Seconds later, a deep silence overtook the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "I slowly opened my eyes...it was gone. All of it: the car, the corpse, everything. My heart was beating out of my chest as I tried to catch my breath. The smell of gasoline and rotten flesh still lingered in the air. Just as I began to calm myself, the factory lights flickered on, and the conveyer belt sprung to life once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I whipped my light rapidly around the room. Feelings of confusion and anger pulsed through my body. I looked towards the conveyer belt, as new objects began to appear. I crept forward to get a better look. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were toys… Benjamin’s toys.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recognized them immediately. The Teddy bear I bought him for his second birthday, his first bicycle, toy trucks, games, and action figures. They rode along the conveyer belt, evenly spaced a couple feet apart. The toys on the belt fed into the next room. My fear and confusion had subsided and were replaced with burning rage. Who was doing this? Who was torturing me? \n",
      "\n",
      "My questions were answered as I kicked open the door of the next room. \n",
      "\n",
      "Standing in the middle of the floor was my son. It had been years since I had seen him. Behind him stood a figure much taller than me and dressed in a dark, hooded cloak. Its face was completely shadowed. Two frail hands were outstretched and resting on Benjamin’s shoulders. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him go. Now!” I spat as I pulled back the hammer of the revolver. \n",
      "\n",
      "They both remained still and unwavering. \n",
      "\n",
      "“NOW!” I screamed as I fired a round into the ceiling. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Father,” Benjamin said. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Ben…I … please come with me. We have to get you home,” I cried. \n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke again. “Each day father, with every drink... you dig the grave a little deeper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And before my eyes, his body withered away. In its wake, hundreds of black rose petals slowly fell to the ground, forming a large pile on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hooded figure remained. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you do!? Bring him back!” I cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure slowly pulled back his hood, and I looked in disbelief. A disfigured version of myself stood before me. His contorted face grinned as he raised a bottle of amber liquid to its mouth and took a drink. A horrible, in-human laugh escaped its mouth and filled the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "Without hesitation, I fired a bullet straight into the monstrosity’s head, and my world fell into silence. \n",
      "....\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright lights and machine noises flooded my senses. I whipped my head around and frantically scanned the unfamiliar room. I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t respond. Even then, leather straps fastened my hands to a cold, steel bed—I was trapped.\n",
      "A doctor in a white coat walked in and sat next to my bedside. He smiled as he explained how lucky I was. Lucky that a neighbor walking their dog happened to hear the gunshot and called an ambulance, lucky that I had just awoke from a month-long coma, and lucky that someone cared enough to send me flowers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at the bedside table and gazed at a vase full of jet black roses—and for the first time in a decade, I didn’t feel like having a drink. \n",
      "Yesterday was one of the longest I've had in a while between the all day doctors appointments, managing my 9 month old white nothing to do in a hospital, and the 4 hour drive back home immediately after. I'm exhausted but happy to have some answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baby Girl has what is called a Double Inlet Left Ventricle heart defect. Basically it means her ventricles have no wall between them so they function as one pump. Also her pulmonary artery is closed so her heart has found a way to basically allow blood to flow backwards through the ductus of her heart and allow blood to the lungs after birth. However without surgery after birth and a series of surgeries within the first three years of life she won't survive more than a few days. Currently the oldest patients with this kind of defects are 30-40 years old. They seem to do really well in childhood but start to decline in adulthood. But with medical advances who knows where we could be in 10-20 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm having an amniocentesis done later this week to check for further genetic abnormalities. If any are present my husband wants to have the baby and put her in comfort care and let her pass. His reasoning is that having genetic factors limits options for things like transplants and he doesn't want to raise our daughter just to bury her later, which I completely understand.  I, however, want to allow her to complete the surgeries regardless. They have a 70-80% of survival and can allow her to live longer as new treatments are developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way I'll be delivering 4 hours away from where we currently live and be in the hospital for at least a month after. If the baby shows no genetic abnormalities my husband wants to move to the city that I'll deliver in. I honestly wouldn't mind as it would make our lives easier because our son already receives treatment there and it's 30 mins away from his family. I'm just dreading a second move while pregnant and leaving my entire family behind. \n",

      "So hello everyone! I’ve lurked this subreddit for a few months deciding if I wanted to try keto out. I started my keto journey 19 days ago weighing in at 250 pounds. This morning I’m currently weighing 226 pounds. I have a goal to reach about 200 pounds, and then bulk up after that. My mind and body feel so much better, and reading posts I was able to sneak by the keto flu at first. So I figured my first post here would be a mix of a introduction / progress and a thank you post. You all are so very informative and any questions I had were either answered in the FAQ or in posts made that I saw. That’s really all I got right now, but I’m gonna start posting more and trying to help others with the knowledge I’ve learned here!\n",

He is young, virile, and like your secretary, is 22 years old.
