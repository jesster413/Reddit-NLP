8nl606,"😂😂😂😂😂 you're just a dumb, impotent, angry little child that won't actually do anything. Why you such a punk? Do those emotions come in adult?? Because it seems like you can't handle the ones you got now 😂😂😂😂😂"
8nlanp,My only point is that recoup your losses is a much better term than turn a profit for this situation. You said the goal is not to make a consistent profit you will in fact not make consistent profits and you will be recouping your losses.
8nlf5f,"No worries. If you sin then you need to repent. Repent means to turn away (change your mind and behavior) about sin. 

Yes, always ask for forgiveness because being saved is a relationship between you and Christ. A continual conversation with you and God through Christ. "
8nlhuo,"Opportunities are always presenting themselves so you have to pick and choose which ones are best for you.

I couldn’t afford moving out of my parents house either for the longest time but your best option to get out quickly is to live with roommates. Cuts the price of rent and you can meet new people through them.

You have to remember these situations are temporary and keep moving forward. I definitely agree with the other person commenting that focusing on the positives will help you the most in times like these. Believe in yourself and you can do it!"
8nlqwk,"You just ignored the broader point of everything to nitpick the difference between (1) an undefined, but clearly abnormally large, ""a lot"" and (2) ""absurd amount.""

  


I only ever said ""absurd"" to contrast the two sides of the argument, but you were less interested with understanding that than with being insulting for no reason (other than i assume to bolster your own ego).

  


It's also completely irrelvant because the actual meat of the discussion (ignoring your constant attempts to ""win"" with asinine rhetorical bullshit) is whether paying *too* much (however much that ends up being) ends up with candidates less interested in the work than the pay. "
8nm0fl,"No, I already have, doesn’t work. Did you know the suicide hotline puts you on hold, and plays shitty music.:)"
8nm73x,"Apparently, my well rounded education seems to have left me with some empathy and compassion. "
8nmewn,Believing his lies seems to be one simple way.
8nmhhi,You are quickly becoming my favourite Reddit account. 
8nmow9,Periscopes are cool. 
8nmpzk,>Yes it's called being an adult. 
8nmtne,"The only thing you're contributing to is how pissed off end users get when using software you configured. 

I'm just kidding, the world needs sys admins dude. Keep doing what you're doing :D"
8nmvqb,Probably so then!
8nmwqa,Okay sure but what about your constipation
8nn6jy,Let's put it this way.  An invoice is a contract and you are advising people to willfully create and document and refuse the intended recipient a copy of it.  You can do whatever the fuck you want and anybody dumb enough to follow your advice deserves to be sued and hunted down by irs.
8nn95z,He's still speaking the truth with that tweet. You'd just Google anyone I'd link you and pull up whatever dirt you could find and come back to post. Sad
8nneak,"Hypothetically, if i held a demonstration and was letting people use my megaphone, and someone sent an obscene message, who would get arrested? Would it be me because it is my megaphone or the person who actually sent it?"
8nnjqe,F
8nnoyh,Xddd
8nogl0,"I find it quite funny that you’re resorting to petty insults as well, looks like I hit a nerve. Calm down."
8noo1r,Haha yup you walked away from the argument just as I suspected you would. So I’m supposed to give the left leaning guys on this subreddit a pass for calling my side murderous? But calling your side lazy is going to far? Gimme a break. Either you’re a bunch of butthurt pussies or you want different sides to play by different rules. 
8nornq,"Most titans of industry who acquired 10+ billion in wealth are famous, those that inherited already massively successful business aren’t as interesting. You have a childish view of successful people and capitalists."
8nou82,"A. It was a shooting foul because Durant was gathering towards the basket.

B. The Warriors were in the bonus so they should have been shooting anyway.

So let me get this straight the unfair call that went in the warriors favor was one that lead to FTs for a play in which they should have been shooting FTs if the correct call was made to begin with. So the Warriors got an unfair foul call because it didn't override an unfair call that was missed earlier.

ALSO YOU KEEP REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SHITTY FOUL CALL ON KLAY ON THE LAST PLAY OF REGULATION."
8np2qv,"Because... God is that conversation boring.  Why is it that you find it so easy to understand a series of events can lead to selling crack?  I don't.  That is what is driving my side of conversation.  Why is this ""yeah but"" so easy to arrive at?  That is what I am looking for.  "
8np3js,Yikes by far I think it’s mainly because I saw how hype and happy Ye was when it drop.
8np6hz,"I said the writers of the bible choosing *our hour* and *our mile* would be an arbitrary choice.  They didn't even have that kind of concept for speed measurement.  That's why boats use knots.

If you think a Roman era mile and a modern one are the same I have a bridge to sell you."
8npdh5,Thanks :)
8nq5z6,You don’t even own. Why the fuck are we even having this conversation? 
8nq9js,You are reusing the same two insults without even attempting to validate the point that is being challenged. This is like toddler level tactics.
8nqgr5,"I see where there could be misunderstanding. I meant the players and former players are pretentious bunch. Not the fans.

England in my comment referred to the team, not the people, but I see it can be interpreted in the other way. "
8nqles,"I would have react the same way if someone would say pp is far right or podemos is venezuela, those are stupid narratives that we have to eliminate."
8nqxw1,Superjail is pretty good. I still love Futurama and South Park as well 
8nqy5s,K
8nr18g,"After the formation of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 1924, the first death caused by an escaped zoo animal occurred in 2007. That's 1 death in 83 years. Comparatively, 24,000 people die EVERY YEAR from lightening strikes. To say the odds of being killed by a zoo animal are higher than being killed by lightening is grossly inaccurate."
8nr3ju,Don’t ask questions you don’t want to know the answer to.
8nr4pb,"I literally admitted in an earlier post to you that I was wrong about referring to the award accomplishments of the movie. Are you legitimately this fucking stupid? 

In fact, it's getting quite clear that YOU are the one unwilling to admit to being wrong, as the moment I cleared up your misunderstanding of the movies' gross, you just wrote ""LOL"".

8nrb34,"Whether it's ""fair"" or not, if you use that definition of prejudiced, everyone is prejudice all the time. We all have pre conceived judgments. It's called learning. I have the pre-conceived notion that Chinese people are short compared to Norwegians. I guess I'm prejudiced against Chinese people. "
8nrhq0,"Imagine getting so clowned on that you just start repeating the other side's arguments over and over.

Old canon he straight up told Han about his lover, Bria, dying while on the Death Star plans mission. He did it because Bria’s dad asked him to. "
