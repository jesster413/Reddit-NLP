1,8nlanp,My only point is that recoup your losses is a much better term than turn a profit for this situation. You said the goal is not to make a consistent profit you will in fact not make consistent profits and you will be recouping your losses.,0.2249,0.146,0.692,0.163

I couldn’t afford moving out of my parents house either for the longest time but your best option to get out quickly is to live with roommates. Cuts the price of rent and you can meet new people through them.

You have to remember these situations are temporary and keep moving forward. I definitely agree with the other person commenting that focusing on the positives will help you the most in times like these. Believe in yourself and you can do it!",0.9804,0.023,0.736,0.241
4,8nlqwk,"You just ignored the broader point of everything to nitpick the difference between (1) an undefined, but clearly abnormally large, ""a lot"" and (2) ""absurd amount.""

  


I only ever said ""absurd"" to contrast the two sides of the argument, but you were less interested with understanding that than with being insulting for no reason (other than i assume to bolster your own ego).

  


It's also completely irrelvant because the actual meat of the discussion (ignoring your constant attempts to ""win"" with asinine rhetorical bullshit) is whether paying *too* much (however much that ends up being) ends up with candidates less interested in the work than the pay.

22,8nou82,"A. It was a shooting foul because Durant was gathering towards the basket.

B. The Warriors were in the bonus so they should have been shooting anyway.

So let me get this straight the unfair call that went in the warriors favor was one that lead to FTs for a play in which they should have been shooting FTs if the correct call was made to begin with. So the Warriors got an unfair foul call because it didn't override an unfair call that was missed earlier.
