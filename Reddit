8nr5lm,gneiss_k,My husband and I are idiots. We've been bamboozled by a financial advisor.,personalfinance,12946527,5394,5394,0,1215,1,"Ugh I'm so frustrated. I thought we were doing a good thing for ourselves but now I think we are trapped.

Full backstory: A friend recommended their ""financial advisor"" to us. We thought ""Great! We've been meaning to meet with someone... we have a kid on the way and husband isn't putting away anything towards retirement since starting his new job in August"". 

So we set up phone meeting with his friend from Northwestern Mutual. She gives us a call, and we end up speaking with her for over an hour. She asks us lots of questions- what we are looking for (we tell her we want to set up retirement stuff for husband and explore maybe putting some of our 17k in savings into CD's or mutual funds). She asks us questions about when we see ourselves retiring, how ""aggressive"" we are, etc. All good stuff. We hang up and agree to talk again in a week when she will give us a plan.

Cut to a week later, we are having a phone meeting with her and she emails me THE PLAN. It's many many pages basically explaining what we have vs. what we will need if we want to retire.  But she mostly just talks about how we need more life insurance. ""Sure"" we think. Maybe we do need more life insurance. She explains that husband needs at least $1mill in life insurance and I need $500k (we both already have $150k policies through work on ourselves). This is news to us but we hear her out. She also spends a ton of time explaining how we need to have disability insurance. Again, we think ""maybe we do"". So we spend the greater part of an hour and a half talking about life insurance and long term disability insurance. She briefly mentions we should be maxing out my Roth IRA and we could perhaps start one for husband. So we hang up, with plans to talk again in a week and sign some paperwork.

Over the next week, husband and I really realize that we don't want disability insurance (she quoted us paying like $170/month) and we didn't really feel we needed more life insurance at this time (she had us paying $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term). But we were ok maxing out my Roth at $450/month. We also wanted to explore stocks/bonds/CD's/mutual funds more (like we initially told her). So I sent this all to her in an email before our next meeting. She sends back ""OK, great! Sounds good.. talk soon"".

Cut to another phone meeting, where she would talk with us about our updated PLAN. She emails us the NEW PLAN while we are on the phone. LITERALLY NOTHING IS CHANGED. She proceeds to spend the next hour convincing us why we need life insurance and disability insurance. Husband and I are both pushovers and listen to the whole schpeel again. Every time we bring up a reason why we don't feel like we need it, she tells us how we are wrong. I mean, she's the professional, we thought. I still expressed my disinterest in disability insurance but wasn't completely closing the door on life insurance. She kept giving me the guilt trip on ""what will your kids have if one of you dies!"". By the end of the conversation, I hadn't agreed to anything except to roll over my Roth to Northwestern. She had me give her my bank routing info to get ""the paperwork started"". She also said she was going to be sending me a bunch of stuff to sign in the next few weeks, but it was just to apply for things... nothing was set in stone. We could just see what the insurance company was going to quote us at, and we still aren't committed to anything. ""Ugh fine"" I think. She says a small amount might be taken out of my checking, but its just to make sure ""the charges are able to go through when we start moving more money to my Roth"".

SO a week or two goes by. And I see a ~$30 charge go through for ""disability insurance"". WHICH I TOLD HER I DIDN'T WANT!! And I just realize... this doesn't feel good. It doesn't seem right. She's not listening to what we want. She still hasn't addressed out interest in CD/mutual funds/stocks that we initially came to her for. I spend the weekend doing my due diligence- spending a few hours on r/personalfinance, NerdWallet, just googling in general about what husband and I should really be doing. I decide to call the whole thing off with Northwestern.

It's been a nightmare trying to cut off ties with her. I was kind and courteous through the first couple emails and subsequent texts ""We really appreciate your time but have decided to pull out. Again, thank you"". 

She is being evasive and manipulative. Telling us we are completely wrong and we still need to work with her. At this point I have just ignored any further communication. It has just been a really bad experience. 


But THE REAL REASON I still feel like I can't completely ignore her, is that I asked her several times when I should expect to see a refund for the disability insurance THAT I DID NOT WANT AND DID NOT AGREE TO. She just dances around the question. I'm also worried because I have gotten a ""bill"" (no charges yet) in the mail for the $340/month in permanent and $125/month in term and $170 in short term disability. 

Is there anything I can do to make sure I don't get charged this? If I communicate with her any farther, she just tries to talk to us about why we need to invest with her, etc.

I recently visited the US and what shocked me most wasn’t the enormous size and low price of the fast food, nor was it rampant drug abuse almost everywhere we went.

**It was the size of the fucking gaps in toilet stalls!**

After lunch, about an hour ago, I took my customary early afternoon shit ready to knuckle down towards the weekend. I hadn’t been feeling great for most of the week (blame too much Guinness on a Dublin stag party over the Bank Holiday weekend), and my shits had been coming out like the water in those UNICEF commercials. In colour and consistency.

So, imagine my surprise when today I squatted down (I’m not a sitter in public) I had to actually push, rather than having my insides fall out like they’d been hurtled from space.
There are only two cubicles on my floor, but they’re well built, minimal gaps, they feel quite secluded. The one next to me was now occupied as I’d heard someone enter, and I was eager to leave.

After another minute of straining I stood up, unsatisfied with my progress, but calves and thighs aching from squatting. I looked down into the bowl to see nothing more than a few paltry nuggets floating on the water. As I went to wipe, I felt a few more stragglers that I hadn’t managed to expel, confident I’d get them here.

To my horror, as I wiped one of these solid, spherical nuggets dislodged itself, and in what seemed like slow motion, fell to the floor and rolled under to the next stall. It rolled through in the centre of the tiniest of cracks, and I’m sure in full view of whoever was unlucky enough to have wandered in next to me.
 
I didn’t even run the risk of another wipe. I opened the door, barely having time to pull up my pants, and sprinted out of the bathroom, and shuffled out of the building. 

I’m back at my desk, nobody has mentioned the poop sharer. But I can’t help but feel all eyes on me.

FML.

TL;DR: My shit rolled underneath the cubicle next to me at work. I panicked and ran.

Edit: Damn, out of everything I’ve posted THIS is the one that blew up.

So first, those disgusted at my lack of handwashing, I didn’t have my fingers in my rectum, my hands weren’t covered in shit. Rest assured the first thing I did was run to the mall across from work and finish wiping/wash my hands. It wasn’t like a went straight to preparing sushi.

Secondly, for those of you that thought I was ragging on the Good Ol’ US of A, that wasn’t my intention. I loved every bit of there beautiful country I had the pleasure of visiting. June Lake, CA was a particular highlight.

My dad, being the cheapskate he was, bought himself and mom decent seats on a flight, and the very back seats for my brother and me. This is a dick move, as my brother is 6'5 and weighs like 240 at this time (he's always been a giant). The poor thing couldn't even sit up straight and had to tuck his legs in. It was to be a five hour flight.

A very nice flight attendant kept checking up on us. Asked us if we were okay, did we need anything. My brother was very polite and said no, he would manage.

The flight attendant kept looking back at us, all worried. She disappears for about five minutes, and comes back with a big smile. She says she can't stand to see my brother so clearly in pain, and they has a lot of space in first class. She tells us the seats are ours, and to follow her to our free upgrade. 

We pass our parents on the way to the front, and my dad asks the flight attendant where we're going. She explains the situation. He asks if he and my mom could sit with us. In a brief moment of genius, I look at the flight attendant, tell her I don't know these people. My brother agrees, and they're left in their inferior seats next to a mom with a crying infant. We got free in flight meals.

*****************

This all happened five or so years ago while I was working for a proprietary trading firm. The company is a multinational and it had opened a new office in my city a couple of years before I joined them. For those who don't know, most prop shops (as I understood it) have a very high turnover rate. Just toss everyone in and keep those who stick. The company I worked for recruited every three months. It had space for about 120 traders but the office was never full. Out of the twenty or so who were hired every quarter, only about five managed to make it beyond the three month internship period, and of those, only one - or sometimes none at all - made it past the additional three months probation period. The company was operating in my city for two years before I joined and there were only about four people who I could have called permanent. Everyone else, about another ten, was either on their internship or on probation.

The Setup.

I and about twenty five others were recruited straight out of university. The internship period paid really well for a first job, about twice as much as any other entry level position in other financial institutions plus bonuses once we went live (regardless of whether one is on internship, probation or permanent), and I was really excited.

I first came across my boss, a really decent Indian guy, at a industry day held in our university. That was where they administered the IQ tests and I passed. The office, similar to other mid-sized operations, had a pretty flat management structure. Us traders were at the lowest level, the HR/Ops manager was above us, and the Office Manager was, well, the head of the branch. The boss gave time off pretty much whenever you asked for it as long as the day's objectives were fulfilled (that was his policy).

However, the HR/Ops manager was his opposite, and then some. This lady was a Grade-A bitch, and I mean that sincerely. Let's call her Gabby.

The Instigating Event

I first met Gabby when I went to their offices for my final interview. I was registering at the front desk when she marched from her office demanding some documents from the receptionist. The receptionist wanted to finish up with me first but she was ordered off to file storage. Our exchange went like so:

Gabby: You're one of the new ones?

Me: Yes. I'm really excited.

Gabby: Don't be. you don't look like you'll make it.

Me: Why?

Gabby: You're too soft.

A pause.

Gabby: Buut... I can put in a good word for you, if you give me a little something. ( a bribe).

Me: Haha. Very funny.

Gabby: I'm serious. Give something and I'll make it very easy for you. Otherwise I'll make sure you don't even get into the interview.

Me: No.

Gabby: Stupid idiot.

Right to my face. And she kept her word. She made me sit in a hidden corner of the waiting room where no one would see me easily, but I could hear the conversations at the desk. The only reason why I got an interview is because apparently I had impressed the boss at our previous meeting that he came to see why my CV wasn't there. Gabby said that I hadn't sent it in. The receptionist stated that she had seen it somewhere. Then I walked up to the desk at the same time the receptionist said, ""Here it is. It was in the trash..."" and everyone stared at Gabby.

From that moment of humiliation onwards, Gabby had a raging hate boner for me. You see, Gabby was a micromanager, more of a nanomanager really. She made us have to request access if we wanted to access sites other than those on her approved list, and for traders who gain info from wherever we could find it, her list was woefully inadequate. She would call meetings at the most inopportune times - but only when the branch manager was not around - and in her lengthy meetings, you could never leave to check on your positions. She had this annoying habit of taking my lunch and when I confronted her about it, she essentially told me to go fuck myself. That I could live with. I just started bringing in two sets of lunch and kept on doing the job that I loved.

Gabby was married with two kids, and she was pretty. I guess she liked the attention because she would have a stream of guys picking her up at the office for two hour 'lunches' and when she left for home some evening. But not on Thursday. Thursdays were the days when her husband would come pick her up towing their kids along. I think they went to have a family dinner or something.

The Mistakes Gabby Made: Round One

Our manager left about two months after I joined. I think he returned to India to get married or something but still stayed with the company. Wished him all the best. None of the other permanent traders had the experience corporate required to take on a management role (5 years at least) so they had to shop around. In the meantime, Gabby became the de-facto head of the branch despite the fact that her knowledge of futures markets was rudimentary at best.

Her first mistake was when she delayed my promotion from internship to probation. I am an excellent trader, and was easily top five in my group. Of the 26, she promoted the twenty she liked, kept me and another guy in internship, and fired four.At around the same time, another recruitment drive happened and another twentyish interns were hired. I knew this was our beef rekindled and remixed, and I was actually surprised she held onto it for so long. It was also pretty unusual since the last thing my former boss did before he left was to promote me from the simulator to a live trading account. But I kept my head down and continued learning, often going back to my former boss and the permanent employees to get advice.

Another three months go by, and in the next evaluation I was shocked that I was still not brought up to probation, despite the fact that all of the new recruits of the second group had been promoted and I was easily the best and the only one trading live. I knew I was good at the job. The permanent guys all said so. The group I initially joined with was frequently asking me for advice. To their credit, a few of them were good, but most of them were still on sim, and as a rule, no one advanced to probation while still on sim. However, you could go live while on internship if you were good which is what had happened to me. So I was a live trader and making good money but I was still on internship and passed over twice. I couldn't let go of that.

I decided to talk to Gabby directly. I approached the senior guys and made my case, though I was careful not to put her in bad light. They agreed to help me and so they did. about a month after the she passed me over the second time, she gave me my promotion and I was now on probation. At this time, she was still unsure of her power and was still afraid of the permanent traders. Those guys were like gods.

Two months after my promotion, another evaluation and recruitment drive. I was not promoted. The group I started out with was now permanent, despite having only two of them trading live. The group I was currently with on probation were all promoted to permanent status. The group behind me on internship was all promoted to probation, and another group was hired. I let it go hoping she had got it out of her system. Sadly, she had not.

Round Two

Three months go by. I'm trading live and loving it, though still on probation. An evaluation comes up again and I'm not promoted, despite the fact that, contract to contract, I was almost on a level with the permanent employees. The group that found me on probation was advanced to permanent status to a man, and none of them were live. the group behind me caught up to me and a new batch of newbies were hired as interns. I couldn't let this one go either. I approached the original four permanent employees who were now my very good buddies and planned to do the same thing as last time. Only this time, it didn't work. Gabby had grown into her sadistic power and flatly refused to even consider my promotion even after she was presented with evidence that I was worth it. Her argument was along the lines of, ""I'm the boss so I can do whatever the hell I want.""

But I wasn't having that, so I contacted my former boss for help. At the time he had been promoted to head of operations, Africa. He was actually quite surprised, given my performance, that I was still on probation. Needless to say, the order came down from on high and Gabby looked like she was shitting six pineapples simultaneously as she handed my letter. And I thought that was the end of it. How wrong I was.

On the next recruitment she hired this girl, let's call her Sue. Sue was an intelligent person all round, but she didn't have the emotional quotient to handle the market (trading, as I was taught, requires two mental aspects: IQ and EQ. You can't improve IQ, but you can boost your EQ to deal with the numerous stresses that accompany the career). Sue had more than enough of the IQ part, but EQ, not so much. No worries, you can work on that.

Just to recap: The office now had about seventy employees. Of these, over thirty were permanent staff (me included) but only eleven were trading live. Another twenty or so were on probation, but only three were trading live. None of the interns were live. The office needed to stay profitable if it was to stay open which means that the money the fourteen live traders were paying the salaries of everyone in the office, rent, supplies, health insurance, pensions etc etc. Needless to say, corporate was not seeing a lot of returns from our branch, and as I came to learn later from my former boss, were considering shutting down the branch and costing us our jobs. But I digress.

The Last Straw

The Grade-A Bitch Gabby took advantage of an inconsolable and desperate Sue to try and get me for sexual harassment. This is how it went down. Remember all those people still on sim? Well, they all came to the eleven of us for trading advice and we did what we could to help them. We divided up the sim traders into groups and I was mentoring about four people. Sue was one of them. As any trader will tell you, the period before profitability is usually one of losses (unless you're really good) and is filled with stress and fear (hence the need for high EQ). It's normal, and you get through it.

Sue was going through such a rough patch one evening. We were going over her trades (bad trading day all around), when she just burst out crying. I know how it feels. I had shed my own tears as well. So comforted her the best I could. I held her hand and patted her on the back awkwardly (to this day I still don't know how to comfort someone) until she quieted down. What I didnt know was that Gabby had seen us.

As I came to learn later, she approached Sue the following day and made her an offer. Gabby would make sure Sue kept her job and would get her a lot of money if she stated that I had sexually harassed her. Sue took Gabby up on the offer and what followed was a nightmare.It started with a formal reprimand from corporate, a hearing in which I wasn't present to defend myself (because Gabby 'forgot' to send me the summons).

Apparently she lobbied quite viciously to get me fired. The only reason I was able to keep my job was that my former boss came to my defence. Despite his help, I lost my quarterly bonus (about US$100,000) and half of my holdback (about US$400,000). I also had to attend seminars which essentially involved watching the same film on sexual assault in the workplace (three hours long) until I stated, in writing, that I was an abuser and it would go on my record. I knew that if that happened, Gabby would have the ammunition she needed to ruin my life forever. So every day, I got into the office at seven in the morning, watched the three hour film until ten. Refuse to acknowledge it, then get to work, leave the office at 11:20 in the evening, rinse and repeat. For almost seven months. It was tiring, and torture, and Gabby never let me live it down.

All of the people I had been mentoring were transferred the day after my reprimand. A day after that, Gabby informed me via letter that my clip size had been cut from 1000 to 20 contracts. Yeah, I had to admit, I was bloodied. I was down, but the bitch didn't know that she should have ended me.

The Revenge

Step 1: Ruin Gabby's Career.

I started compiling all the shit that was happening to me in the office. It started when I realized that when I went out to lunch, someone would open my desk drawer and mess around with my notebook, where I jotted down my trading ideas for the day. The only person who had a key apart from me was Gabby. Apparently she had mastered my lunchtime routine for the entire 45 minute break and would open my locker when I was out smoking. She would then copy down my trading plans for the day and give them to Sue. I even saw them at it once, but they didn't see me. I documented it. I let it go on for a while so that I could establish a pattern via Sue's trades. I then approached two of the permanent traders who were closest to me and told them my plan.

Remember when I said almost no money was reaching corporate? and that there were only eleven live traders? The situation had only gotten worse. The office was now full but we had less that fifteen live traders. Live trading could only be approved by Head of Operations (my former boss) and he was a strict one. Now imagine that my earning capacity had been cut by over 90%. My two friends agreed to my plan and they slowed down their trading by around 50%. This essentially put the branch in the red and three weeks later, we were told that Head of Ops and other head honchos were coming down. The next phase involved getting Sue into a corner. Pleas, a tear or two, and revealing that I could prove she had been stealing my work were enough to get a written statement from her that Gabby had orchestrated my whole sexual harassment thing.

Step 2: Ruin Gabby's Marriage

It took only a little investigation on my part to realize than all those men who visited the office were actually Gabby's lovers. She would leave for two-hour 'lunches' with her phone turned off. I took advantage of one such period. Gabby left and I snuck into her office to find her Facebook profile open. Everyone knew she was always on there and it was a sore point because she had banned it for the rest of us minions. I got into her Messenger, and voila! Explicit texts, nudes, rants about her husband and his inadequacies, the six guys or so she had cheated with, all of it. I copy pasted the data into her private email which she was logged into as well (always clear cache, you guys) and sent it to my private email, then deleted it from her sent folder. Now I had the ammo on my phone ready to send.

Step 3: Ruin Gabby's Relationship with her Kids.

Now, I'll say right off the bat I'm not proud of this step. but to bust my justice nut, it wasn't enough to just send the info to her husband. So I waited for Thursday when I knew he would be passing by the office with the kids. The Pro Revenge gods saw fit to bless me that day, because it was the same day that Corporate Head Honchos were ridin' into town.


Thursday.

I was at the office at seven as usual with all my documentation from my appointment letter to the numerous rejected requests for promotion, sat through the three hour sexual harassment video (yes, I was still doing that), and waited for the Moment. The guys from corporate, my former boss included, arrived and went straight into a meeting with Gabby. I was quite certain that they would call me in to know why I had been attending a sexual harassment awareness class for almost a year, and I was ready for them.

I was called in after lunch, at about two. The question was asked and before I could answer, Gabby jumped on the bit like I knew she would. She went on a long rant about how I had been insubordinate, and how I liked to touch the female employees. I could tell from her grin that she thought she was winning.

And then I pulled out Sue's letter, and the grin curdled on her face. Sue was hurriedly called in and she backed my story. She said she was sorry. She was fired on the spot and told to go wait at the receptionist for her final check. I felt no sympathy. I was on a roll.

Next I pulled out my analysis of my trades and told them how Gabby had been breaking into my locker and stealing my notes for sue. Gabby denied it. Sue was called back in. She denied it. My former boss logged into the company network, pulled Sue's and my trading data. He compared the positions taken by both of us with my notes. He said it was true. Sue was fired again. They told me they would refund my confiscated bonus and holdback, with an extra 50 grand. That was fine by me. The justice was enough.

And then I spotted Gabby's husband heading into her office as usual, their two kids in tow. I pulled out my phone, grinned at her and said,

""You're husband is here.""

She turned around and saw him. She excused herself for a minute to tell him to wait.

My former boss said, ""Sure.""

I pressed send.

TL;DR. Grade-A Bitch tries to ruin my career because I humiliated her, I burn her life to the fucking ground.

EDIT: As for the aftermath, Gabby's husband absolutely lost his shit. Her office was glass-walled and the rest was open-plan so we could all hear what they were shouting about. He finally left with their kids in tow (sorry little ones) Gabby followed him still shouting at him. Then she saw us all standing around and the look on her face was priceless as she was wondering which aspect of her life to try and salvage. She let her husband go, but about an hour later she had been fired.

My favorite boss stayed behind since there was no one left. He stayed for a month training the lady who had been with the company the longest to take over as manager. She is easily the most brilliant mind I had ever met. Unfortunately the branch was still struggling with so many employees who were not generating income and they had to shut it down. But they transferred all the performing employees to their other various branches in London (2 branches) and India (9 branches). So I guess no one undeservedly lost their jobs.

I still stalk Gabby on Facebook. There have been a lot of ""I'm single because I'm too awesome"" posts of late. I almost feel sorry for her, but I remember the three-hour video and I stop being foolish. From what I could see on LinkedIn, Sue bounced around from firm to firm until she found a position as a research analyst. My favorite boss is still at the firm. We talk from time to time.

I took a break from trading for a while. After all the shit that went down, I needed a break so I didn't take them up on their offer to relocate to India. Went to work with a buddy of mine who has a consultancy. When I feel ready I'll go back to the market. For me at least, there is no other job as challenging and satisfying.

About 2 months ago I began working full time from an [old Land Rover Defender 110](https://imgur.com/5yihO6B) that I converted into a rolling home/office. I was tired of London so upped sticks to live a simpler life on the road.

So far I have travelled all across the Alps, where 4G reception has given me *consistently* faster internet than anything I ever had in London \(which is total madness\). I average around 80mb/s each day compared to the pathetic 17mb/s I was getting back home.. Work that one out.. [Here are my recent internet speeds](https://imgur.com/gZf8upF)

I'm the graphic designer for my startup [Reedsy](https://reedsy.com), we fully embrace the remote work culture and have people based all over the world.

I'm far from the first person to try #vanlife, and I find a lot of the hype somewhat staged... you never see the posts of people camped at Walmart, or the day the van breaks down, but I just wanted to show that living on the road is a feasible option for those of us who are lucky to work remotely.

8nr7qi,Ghetto_Moose,[RI]Wife paid $150.00 in copays for multiple visits to a doctor and xrays and was told she was fine. She went to get a second opinion and the doctor identified 3 different fractured areas in her leg/foot in less than 20 minutes. Is a refund possible from the first doctors office?,legaladvice,416193,1792,1792,0,105,0,"She had fallen while hiking last month and for the first week she was in severe pain so went to an urgent care.  At the urgent care they took xrays and said everything was fine.  A week goes on and she is still in severe pain so I booked her an appointment at an orthopedic specialist.  Her first appointment she waited 2 hours and got an xray that he looked at for ~1 minute before telling her there was nothing wrong and just to take 'epsom salt baths' for her foot which was pretty bruised.  A week later she went for a followup with him and again she waited for 2 hours for him to see her for ~2 minutes and he said everything was looking better and she should be fine to get back to hiking.

For the next week she tried walking  bit with me but she was really in pain still and my wife is really fucking tough when it comes to pain tolerance so I got her an appointment at a second specialist.  She not only got in right away but the Doctor sat with her for about 20 minutes asking her 100 questions about the incident while she had new xrays taken and when he got the xrays back he found and showed my wife all the fractures in her leg/foot.

So basically my wife ended up walking on a broken leg/foot for 2weeks+ because one doctor completely misdiagnosed her twice because his office seemed to be really busy/overbooked.  Is there a way to contact my insurance company or this guys' office and have a valid case for a refund here?

8nt8xj,75footubi,But we didn't mean for life,MaliciousCompliance,421820,751,751,0,85,0,"Not my story, but my parents. 

Car involved: 2005 diesel Jetta (the generation before the recalled model)

About 10 years ago, my dad got into a bad accident in the Jetta (woman t-bones him at full speed, left side of the car shot to hell). He starts the claim through his insurance and they start the repairs. The insurance adjuster writes into the repair report that the insurance company put a lifetime guarantee on all repairs done to the car from this accident. Things that were repaired/replaced included the transmission, the condenser, the radiator, serpentine belt, headlights assembly, ECU, etc. Basically, a lot of big ticket items. 

So time wears on, and about three years later the front left headlight needs to be replaced so my dad takes it into the shop and then sends the insurance company through bill. 

Insurance agent: why are you sending this to us?

Dad: it's one of the things repaired after the accident that you guaranteed for life.

Insurance company: we didn't mean lifetime, we meant a year.

Dad: well, the policy says lifetime so you're on the hook.

After a few nasty grams between lawyers, the insurance company pays up. But now, my parents are pissed at the way they've been treated so they resolve to keep the car until the floorboards rust out.

Things that have been replaced on the insurance company dime since then: clutch, radio, left front tire (multiple times), brake pads and rotors, front bumper, driver door window motor, air filter, etc.

The insurance company tried to buy them out a few years ago but my parents refused, and since no limitations were put on the repair policy, the insurance company is on the hook for as long as my parents own the car. It's a manual diesel so it's going to live forever.

It meant that at the time **Dumbledore knew that  Voldemort wouldn't be able to kill Harry as Lily's protection in Harry's blood \(which Voldemort now had\) would bring Harry back to life if he was killed by Voldemort**.

This enabled Harry to get rid of the part of Voldemort's soul that was in him when he let Voldemort kill him in Deathly Hallows, while himself remaining alive, since Lily's protection was alive in Voldemort's veins.

Guys can you sort this dogs dinner of a PC in distribution for me

I came in bright and breezy this morning and switched the offending, antiquated box on – whilst waiting for windows to start loading I packed a couple of despatch items and then turned to look at the screen to be met with the usual message “windows is updating 10&amp;#37;” message

Knowing how slow this computer is I sat back and pondered my life and then began to think about the complexities of space and time. It wasn’t until I had nearly calculated the gravitational pull on an object circulating a wormhole in an elliptical orbit that the message on the screen finally changed.

Much to my distress and consternation however I was met with a new never seen before message “”we couldn’t complete the updates – Undoing changes”. Now given the length of time it took to try and update I realised I could serve my time better by having a cup of tea, so off to the 1st floor for a fresh brew, on returning as expected the message had not changed, we were still undoing – in someways this reversal did make me feel somewhat like Benjamin Button as he actually got younger as time went by in a tortuously long film akin to the length of time  this archaic black box was taking so I decided I would need to shorten my miserable existence on this lonely planet by having a smoke. Now I’m not the fastest smoker of a cigarette in the world and indeed on this occasion I felt no pressure to hurry but even so on my return seeing the same message did crush my dreams and hopes of an early finish for the weekend. I sat down in front of the screen again and hoped, even prayed for a new message or some kind a computer action. My dreams were met shortly afterwards when said PC came up with the reboot message. Enlivened by this I sat up straight expecting to dive back into work with gusto. Unfortunately I received a virtual kick in the nether regions from my black boxed nemesis as it gave me an all too familiar message “we couldn’t complete the updates\- Undoing changes” My life swam around me, memories of the past came flooding back as I relived my time on this earth, the good, the bad, the ugly in a kaleidoscope of images, I summoned my last will of hope and strained every sinew in my body and started to bang my head against the keyboard again and again and again and… well you get the picture. Eventually as we all know, hope springs eternal and some 45 minutes after 1st attempting to do my duty the sign on screen finally appeared, with some trepidation I entered the password and after a further 5 minutes knobs, buttons keys and the mouse sprang into life. My work was done I thought and then I quickly realised it hadn’t even begun yet which hurt, hurt more than you can ever imagine. 

Anyway I’m now over this harrowing part of my life, things are back on track however it’s an experience I’d rather not repeat again so can I implore you all to remove this offending box and replace it with something more youthful and exuberant, much like my former self.

Kind regards

der Titel sagt schon alles. Bin hier geboren, aufgewachsen, zur Schule gegangen. Ich erscheine pünktlich \(10 Minuten vorher\) zum Termin beim örtlichen Landratsamt. Es wären auch 20 Minuten gewesen, hätte ich nicht vorher eine Bratwurst verdrückt und einen Fahrradfahrer, der auf dem Gehweg unterwegs war, zurechtweisen müssen. Wie dem auch sei, leider habe ich das Pech das ich 1996, also während des Jugoslawienkriegs geboren und einen kosovarischen Pass habe. Also doch nicht Papier\-Deutsch.

Ich wollte mich einbürgern lassen, was ja generell schon bedeutet sich geistig runterzuschrauben und sich erniedrigen zu lassen \(Kreuzen Sie die Vereinigungen an, in denen Sie Mitglied sind \- gefolgt von einem Formular mit Al\-Quaida und ISIS Gruppierungen! SUPER!\). Wie dem auch sei. Antrag gestellt, Gebühr gezahlt, dann kam der Brief:

Sie müssen sich ausbürgern lassen aus dem Kosovo und Serbien. Hä? Warum Serbien, ich habe doch nur einen kosovarischen Pass. Hat wohl was mit der damaligen politischen Lage zu tun. Also hin zum Landratsamt. Nachdem ich einen Termin ausgemacht habe. Und Urlaub genommen.

**Ich: Hey! Schicke Birkenstock\-Sandalen! Bestimmt bequem. Achso, warum ich hier bin. Ich wollte fragen warum...**

&gt;**Sie: ""IST SO! Gesetze sind Gesetze"".**

*Okay, alles klar. Hin zum serbischen Konsulat mit der Bitte um Ausbürgerung:*

&gt;**""Sie müssen erst überprüfen lassen ob sie die serbische Staatsangehörigkeit haben, dafür brauchen wir ihre Dokumente""**

**Ich: Ja easy brudi, hier mein Pass**

&gt;**""Das ist ein kosovarischer Pass. Erkennen wir nicht an. Land gibts nicht""**

**Ich: Logo. Hier mein Aufenthaltstitel und meine deutsche Geburtsurkunde**

&gt;**""Das geht nicht. Wir brauchen ein serbisches Dokument""**

**Ich: Woher? Ich bin in München geboren, war da noch nie**

&gt;**""Von ihr Mutter, oder von ihrem Vater""**

**Ich: Mein Papa ist deutsch. Meine Mama hat keine serbisches Dokumente, nur Kosovo**

&gt;**""Dann können wir ihnen leider nicht helfen""**

*Ich so: Supi, lauf ich halt wieder zum Landratsamt. Also, ich meine, ich habe einen Termin ausgemacht. und mir Urlaub genommen.*

**Ich ""Leider komme ich nicht weiter, können Sie...""**

**Sie: ""IST SO! Gesetze sind Gesetze""**

Ich weiß echt nicht was mich mehr stört. Das die Frau so einen Gefallen an ihrer aktiven Nicht\-Hilfe hat oder ihr penetranter Kaffee\-Mundgeruch. Ich überlege meinen Kosovo\-Pass an Ort und Stelle zu verbrennen und im Zimmer schräg gegenüber Asyl zu beantragen. Habe es sein lassen, hatte kein Bock den Feuerwehreinsatz zu zahlen. Schließlich herrscht hier immer noch die Bayrischen Bauordnung \(BayBO\) und entsprechend auch die Rauchmelderpflicht \(§ 46\).

Alternativ gehe ich einfach weiter arbeiten und zahle meine Steuern, damit die nette Dame sich weiterhin ihren laktosefreien, glutenfreien Kaffee leisten kann.  SCHLAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

""What's in the box"" was his first attempt at something more ""show like"" but he said in Critikals podcast that he couldn't quite get the pieces together. he also mentioned he wanted to do more acted and scripted content. i guess his new attempt is ""Don't Watch This"" but in my opinion it was the most cringy and unfunny shit ian ever put out.

i feel like he's looking to diversify his content but all attempts have been in vain. adding to that is that most of his viewers just want content cops and drama and don't care about his personality. i wouldn't be surprised if he really really disliked his audience.

so, aside from content cops what content would you suggest ian should do? i think he should focus more on the vlogging type stuff, maybe do videos with anisa or his highschool buddy he mentions sometimes and meetup with max more often. he's a naturally funny guy and good at improv. scripted content is the wrong direction, i think.",False,False,6.0,1527860406.0,1527436599.8321111,-423806.1678888798

8no4f8,DarthWinchester,Free roof because my insurance guy wants to play games...,MaliciousCompliance,421820,13576,13576,0,525,0,"I am not sure this is malicious compliance or not, but it was one of my finer moments and I feel the need to share it! Some five or six years ago...

My wife’s grandmother passed and left us her home in her will. The house was rather large, but had been built some time in the 1960s and needed updating. We decided to basically gut the home and do a full remodel. 

First thing was to talk to my insurance guy and see what I needed to do with the insurance. He comes out and explains that I need to do a fire policy, which basically will replace the structure in the event of a major catastrophe. Cool, insurance in place I start remodeling. 

Fast forward seven or eight months and I am done, and so bone tired and mad at the world that my reflection in the mirror tried to avoid me. I was working a rotating shift (days, evenings, midnights) and spending every waking moment working on this house. Five hours a day/night was the most sleep I was getting. I would snap at the wind for blowing I was so strung out. Que the insurance guy and his antics...

While I was sleeping after working midnight shift, my wife has IG (insurance guy) come to look at the house and change the policy back to full coverage. When I wake up for my next shift, she informs me that we have to put a new roof on before he can change the policy. I almost came unglued. I had ripped the ceilings out of this house, so if there had been a roof leak, I am pretty sure I would have found it. Luckily this was Friday evening, so I had the entire weekend to calm down and plot my next move. 

I called first thing  Monday morning and set up an appointment for 8 a.m. Tuesday at the house, and explained to him I was on midnights and to please make sure he was there by 8 a.m. No particular reason, I just hoped it would discomfort him having to be somewhere else that early in the morning (a dick move mostly). Tuesday morning rolls around, and he shows up with his boss. At first this threw me off, but I figure what the hell, two birds, one rock and stuff. 

Me: IG, hows it going?

IG: Pretty good, how are you?

Me: Tired. How bout you show me exactly what is wrong with this roof so we can get going?

IG: Sure thing, step right over here. You see that shingle?

Me: Ya.

IG: See how bad a shape it’s in?

Me: Sure do! (thinking to myself, “hell no, what the fuck are you looking at?”)

IG: And over there see that place?

Me: Yup, gotta bad spot or two there also!

IG: This roof has taken some serious storm damage, it is in rough shape!

We proceed all the way around the house with him pointing at random spots, as far as I could tell, and saying things like “That shingle is shot. Those too. Ya, and right here.” The whole time I just did like a chicken pecking and affirmed him with “Yup! You’re right” All the while his boss is saying nothing. 

After he is finished pointing out all of these bad places,

IG: So see, you will have to replace that roof before we can cover it. 

Me: Your right, I had been so busy on the inside I hadn’t paid much attention. So, can you file the claim for me, or do I need to go talk to one of the ladies down at the office?

IG: CLAIM??!! What do you mean a claim!!???

Me: Well, best I can figure it was those bad storms back in April that did all this damage, and y’all were covering it through my GMIL’s policy, so I reckon y’all would be who I s’posed to talk to right? 
 
(I like turning the backwoods country accent up to 11 when dealing with people who think they are smarter than me, adds flavor to the humble pie for them)

IG: Well now, hold on. 

Me: Naw, you’re a hunnerd percent right. It’s took some serious storm damage, and we ain’t had none since that bout back in April. Now, I put the fire policy on in July, so any damage done woulda fell back on the old policy. 

IG: ......(standing there sucking air like it’s gonna run out)

IG’s boss: He’s right. And since they have a year to file that claim, we will have to do it. Get the paperwork started and let me know if you need help.



I am no roof expert, the roof could have been shot all to hell for all I know. It looked good, and didn’t leak. After I explained to the adjuster what the whole deal was about, he found enough other stuff wrong so that I wasn’t out one nickel on an entire new roof!

TLDR: Insurance guy decided to be a jack wagon for some reason, and I got a free roof out of the deal!


Edit: A few points to help clear things up some. 

My wife was executor of the estate, and had a POA for the deceased. 

I referenced the storms in April because that year there were multiple bad hail storms that came through. Car dealerships lost entire inventories from these storms. It was an insurance nightmare all year long, which was why nothing was really questioned. The rest of that year was fairly calm weather wise, so it was most likely the event that “destroyed” the roof. 

The roof was about 5 years old give or take. Wear and tear wasn’t a concern, and the insurance company had held the policy on the house since forever and were familiar with it. 

IG was wanting me to pay for the roof out of my pocket. If this had been pointed out in July when I had the policy changed originally it would not have irritated me as much. After spending the entire summer and fall working on the house and him popping up with “Oh yeah by the way”, yes it rubbed me the wrong way. 

I am a hick, bumpkin, and some of the other names mentioned. I love that people automatically shave 30 points off of my IQ for talking the way I do (insert jokes about my now negative IQ here please). It gives me a distinct advantage when someone does this. Yes I play it up for my own amusement/benefit. It is no different than a woman using her looks, a policeman using his badge, or any of the other advantages people use daily. 

I do not type in my southern accent all the time because it isn’t easy. It’s almost like making a language up as you go, and if it is that hard for me to type, I can only imagine what someone who is unfamiliar with the vernacular would go through reading it. I would imagine there would be migraines and brain scans involved before they got to the end of the post.

8nrvfx,TonyLund,We are an international group of leading physicists (including many Nobel laureates) assembled here at Case Western Reserve University to celebrate 50 years of “the most successful theory known to humankind”… and explore what the next 50 years might hold! Ask us anything!,IAmA,18004576,732,732,0,630,5,"Hi Reddit! 

In honor of the 50th anniversary of Steven Weinberg’s world-changing publication, A Model of Leptons, the work that solidified what we now call “The Standard Model of Physics”, Case Western Reserve University is hosting a once-in-lifetime symposium this weekend that features talks from many of the most famous names in physics… including 8 Nobelists and over 20 scientists who have made immeasurable contributions to the “the most successful theory known to humankind.” We’re here to honor this world-changing scientific work, but perhaps most important of all, look to the next 50 years of probing the deepest mysteries of the Universe… what incredible wonders might be out there waiting to be discovered? Are we on the verge of solving the great mysteries of Dark Matter and Dark Energy? Will we soon know exactly what happened in the very first moments of our Universe’s birth? And… could a working theory of Quantum Gravity finally be within reach?

The talks will be live-streamed all weekend long [here]( 
https://case.edu/livestream/s1/):
Science Writer-Filmmaker /u/TonyLund will be hanging out in the live stream chat box to translate the science in real time. 

But before we all get to work, we wanted to spend some time with you all! Ask us anything!

Then Rome began to expand as the kingdom and then later republic to dominate Italia.

My question is what happened to these pre-existing people? Were they and their cultures integrated or incorporated? Eradicated? Culturally replaced? Or did the people spreading across Italia e Sicilia hold a sense of identity beyond being a roman citizen?

There wasn’t much left besides perhaps a few “post\-apocalyptic” groups doing their best to survive on the desert, sand, dust, and salt water. They won’t last much longer, if there are even any left at all. The rest of us are up here among 30 different stations.

My great, great grandparents scored a ride up here. Being an affluent and intelligent couple \(brain surgeon and NASA technician\), they were obvious candidates for one of the American stations in 2065, when this all began.

It wasn’t until 2082 that Earth started to become uninhabitable for the population and our station started filling up. They had all the numbers worked out though, cutting off the capacity with just enough space for the population to wax and wane at a constant rate. I still wonder what it must have felt like for those people who could not afford the trip and were left on Earth to suffer and die. However it was so long ago, it’s hard for me to relate. Especially when I’ve never seen Earth for myself.

It’s 2197 now, I’m 25, and I know this station like the back of my hand. Where to get any leftovers for those nights when your stomach won’t stop growling, the best hook\-up spots, where my friends and I hide the only deck of cards with ALL 52 cards. Our station head, President Anton Fowler, keeps things fairly strict. Punishable crimes mostly come from trying to pull a fast one over the authorities here. The only thing that would be punishable from my list above is stealing food. I’ve been sent to a week of solitude for stealing leftover stale bread one night when all they served for dinner was wrinkly beans and inedible hard, green bananas. At the time, our station farm wasn’t producing enough food at the rate it was supposed to. I shouldn’t complain about that though. Last year’s fall was the toughest. Weak harvest and at least 20 more births per month than they expected. I guess scientific population projections aren’t always consistent when there’s not much more to do than have sex on this station. I heard the Chinese stations have 10 more basketball courts than us, a swimming pool, and music rooms. Who knows if that’s true. Maybe if we had more basketball courts people would stop having babies. Seems legit.

However, yesterday morning is the start of when everything spiraled out of control.

“Yoooo girl, I didn’t think I’d run into you down here,” Celeste called to me. She’s not wrong, I don’t typically venture down to the library. But I was looking for a poetry book my hook\-up buddy, Jack, suggested I read. He’s one of those literary types: glasses, messy hair, always lost in thought. I knew that if I wanted to keep him somewhat interested in me I had to show some interest in this hipster shit. I’m not really into emotions or poetry, but whatever. Girls gotta get laid.

Celeste bounded over with an intense and heavy looking physics book under her arm.

“Do people still really say “yo”, Celeste?” I replied irritably. I mean god, I know I didn’t do stellar in secondary school but I’m allowed to be in the freakin’ library. “You’re aging yourself, you know.” I added lightly.

She rolled her eyes. “Whatever dude, I’m old school and guys love a girl who uses *vintage* terms and knows who Kendrick Lamar is.  Speaking of dudes.. I wonder who suggested THAT book to you.” She pointed at ‘Leaves of Grass’ in my grasp. We began walking toward the exit of the library.

I tried and failed to stifle a laugh. I’m just really not the poetry type, I can’t emphasize that enough.

“Yeah, well I have to keep him interested. There’s only so many good looking dudes on this station. Maybe I need to apply for abroad, just so I can meet a man. Do you think if I tell them I need to get dick they’ll let me head over to Station 7?” This had Celeste dying. No one goes abroad to other stations except the President and other higher level employees every so often.

“Doubtful, but you’re right he is good looking. When are you seeing him again?” She pried.

“Later today. I’ve got to read some of this thing before we meet up. I told him I was checking it out a week ago.” Uhg… dating definitely isn’t worth it.

“Jesus Tara, wait till the last minute why don’t you?” She teased, pretending to be shocked.

I shrugged. “You know me, always gotta be on a short deadline.”

“Yeah, well hopefully you can read fast. I’ve got to catch up on some of this shit myself,” she wiggled her book in the air. “My boss asked me if I had read the latest edition, the one the Russians on Station 2 corrected. Damn Russians, they’re supposed to make my job easier, not harder.” Celeste worked in the technology department. I’m not even entirely sure what her job is there, but yeah, she’s smart,

“Ha, well good luck with that. I wouldn’t want to be you right now.” Just looking at the physics book she held made me bored.  You’d think by 25 I’d know what I wanted to do with my pathetic space station life, but alas. I gave Celeste side\-hug as we parted and took opposite ways at the fork in the hallway.

I spent the majority of the late morning and early afternoon trying to decipher whatever the hell Walt Whitman was trying to get across to me. Once again, I found myself wondering if this was really worth it and also wondering if I was just a super desperate chick. I didn’t have much else to do on my day off though. But man, Walt Whitman could write, and by that, I mean he could write a lot. This book was fucking long. I got distracted about 8 times before I gave the book a real try and started with what I knew was one of his more famous poems. Half an hour of reading went by...

*All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,*

*And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.*

*Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?*

*I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I*

*know it.*

*I know it.*

*I know it.*

*I know it.*

*I know….*

I’m walking through fields of green. What is this stuff? It’s so green, I’ve never seen something so vibrant on the station. It’s so soft, too! I decide to lay down. I can feel the prickly, soft greenery between my fingers. Then I hear something mechanical, growing louder and louder. Suddenly, I’m tossed into the air as the comforting material under me is ripped forcefully from the ground by god knows what. I fall hard onto metal and all of the color is gone.

*All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses, And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier!!!*

What the hell, who is screaming these words? I look up and see Celeste screaming about 50 feet away from me. Blood is dripping from her nose. I try to get up but my legs are heavy. Why can’t I fucking run!? Or scream!? Or open my eyes? *Open your eyes, Tara.*

I slowly woke up. My heart pounding, I glanced around my dim room.

“Uhhhhhhhhhhhh….” I breathed, judging myself for once again for having the most screwed up dreams. This is why I don’t read. My brain reads one thing and my imagination and anxiety run with it, every time.

I looked over at my clock and read *17:00.*

“SHIT!”. I stumbled to the sink to brush my teeth and fix my slumping ponytail. I was supposed to meet Jack in one of the abandoned labs a half\-hour ago. All of that reading for him and I oversleep, just my luck.

I scrambled out of my cabin into the empty corridor. Fumbling my keys while pulling my sweater over my head, I rushed down the hall. It’s about a 20 minute walk to the abandoned lab. My mind was so occupied over the thought of being late to meet Jack, I almost didn’t notice that I was the only one walking the corridors. This wouldn’t be unusual in the wing closer to my cabin, but I was close to the hub: the main section of station. Out of the silence, a voice boomed over the emergency speaker.

“LAST ANNOUNCEMENT: ALL STATION 11 CITIZENS TO THE HUB STADIUM. MANDATORY STATION 11 MEETING IN THE HUB STADIUM.”

Well, that explains it. They’ve called us to the stadium before. When the Russian station went up in flames 10 years ago, when we had the food shortage last year \(well, to be honest we always have a food shortage, but that was an exceptionally bad time\). I became slightly nervous as I hurried down to the stadium. Obviously, I had slept through the previous announcements. At this point I knew the stadium would be fairly full, so I went straight to the upper levels.

Everyone was sitting, waiting anxiously for President Fowler to address the crowd. I took a roomy seat near the exit, next to a man in his what I guessed to be his 60s. I closed my eyes for a moment. At least Jack won’t know I messed up and over slept. He always eyes me, I assume judging me, when he finds out more about my messy and irresponsible life. He has his shit together. I do not.

Five minutes pass, then ten. The crowd was becoming restless. The guy next to me sighed and  turned to me, “It’d be nice if our President could be on time for once...damn Fowler.” He grumbled.

I merely arched my eyebrows and gave him a look that I hoped showed exasperation. Old people are always so impatient. And honestly, I don’t pay much attention to politics.

As I turned away a crackle came over the speaker and a cool, mechanical female voice began speaking. The crowd quieted.

“Attention Station 11 citizens. Our station has a beautiful and fully functioning community that must be maintained. However, the size of our current population is pushing the boundaries of this perfectly planned society. We thank those of you in advance who will be making sacrifice for the greater good of Station 11.”

*Wait, whoa did they just say sacrifice?* I straightened up out of my slump and met eyes again with the man next to me. The crowd was completely silent\- not a murmur, not a breath. The cool, calm voice continued.

“We have planned and run time trials. The doors to this stadium will lock 4 minutes after this announcement ends. Our flawless procedure will leave 40&amp;#37; of you remaining in this stadium after the doors lock. Further instructions from there. The 60&amp;#37; of you who make it out will continue life on Station 11. Proceed.”

*What...the fuck?* With a click, the speaker went off. Confusion followed.

It’s a blur trying to remember what happened. A blur of pure panic, yelling, and stampeding. I stood up slowly feeling like I was in a daze. The man next me yelled “WHAT are you doing? GO!” and gave me a hard shove.

I was close to the exit so I made it out of the stadium in about 20 seconds. Across the hall outside of the stadium was one of my childhood hiding spots. A crook in the wall where a water fountain used to be. We would hide the good board games behind the drywall they placed over the old pipes when we were kids. I wedged myself in the crawl space to avoid the stampeding crowd that was sure to be right behind me.

As I watched the panicked crowd running, I felt my chest constrict. My eyes started burning. My mouth felt dry. Was this real? Was this happening? I shook my head to try and wake myself from another one of my fucked up nightmares. But I was still there, hiding in my crook.

3 loud beeps and the doors started to shut. The crowd remaining in the stadium was scrambling, pressed up against the door windows. Their faces didn’t even look human at this point from the amount of sheer terror, revealing their most primal instincts.

I immediately sprinted to the doors and made a weak attempt to pry them open. No luck. I looked down and there was blood dripping down the door frame. Fingers. Someone’s fingers were on the floor. Cut clean off by the force of the doors shutting, stopping for no one.

*No no no.* And my head is spinning.

There are others around me who made it out trying to force the doors open. Others standing off to the side, dumbstruck, trying to comprehend the events that happened in the last five minutes. 20 minutes of our pitiful attempts to open the doors until the voice came on over the speaker throughout the entire station. Collected and cold.

“Citizens of the 60&amp;#37;. Discontinue attempts to open the doors. They are feeble and will not bring desired results.  Return to your cabin and continue your daily routines.”

People were in tears, yelling loved ones names, scrambling to find friends or still trying to yank the doors open. Hours passed and the crowd dispersed, but only slightly. Most of us in the 60&amp;#37; made camp. We used jackets to lay on the ground in the corridors and waited to see what sacrifice the 40&amp;#37; will be asked to make, still hoping and praying that this was all an experiment. A test of some kind that will end shortly.

I don’t remember falling asleep but it must not have been long. Movement woke me up. I opened my eyes to see people crowding the doors again. Someone nudged my right arm. A young girl, in her teens, looked at me through warm amber eyes.

“They said they are going to make another announcement to the 40&amp;#37;.”

She stuck out her hand, pulled me up. As we hurried over to the closest set of double doors, I over heard a defeated looking older man with glasses and tears sparkling in his eyes mumbling to another boy about my age.

""...saw them doin' a large transfer for abroad this morning. Sure to have been full of authorities to the main station...  cowards can't even stay to see through their plan...""

We reached the doors. There were about 15 of us semi\-circled around the area, waiting.

“Attention citizens of the 40&amp;#37;. You have made a great sacrifice for the future of Station 11 and the continuation of the human species. We will honor you for your contribution to our future. Our station has been slowly overpopulating for the last 4 decades. We hoped that the population would even out naturally, however the birth rate was increasing steadily. Because of this, we have devised this plan. A plan where 40&amp;#37; of you will give up your lives for others to live theirs. Those of you who are weaker, slower, smaller, potentially older and those who could not make it out of the stadium in the allotted time will be sent to the beyond. You are just as lucky as the 60&amp;#37; who will live, just as lucky as them to die for Station 11.”

I steadily looked around me. Horror was struck across faces. I touched my cheek because this really couldn’t be real, right? Inside the stadium the walls began to move. White, egg\-shaped capsules began to emerge from the walls. Rows and rows of them began to pour from the walls of the stadium.

“There is a pod for each of you. When you are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, you will enter your pod, close the lid, lay down, and consume the pill in the case on the left wall of the pod. The pill will ease you into a deep sleep. The pod will then be sent into space and beyond. You will not wake and you will honor you for the rest of our time on Station 11.”

Screams could be heard from within the stadium. People banged on the windows on the double doors, tears streaming down their face, clawing to get out. The 60&amp;#37; yelled and pulled again. Screaming at the speakers. Cursing at and calling for President Fowler. I backed away slowly, feeling numb.

Behind me was a long hallway, so I turned and began walking. I started to jog and then run. I knew where I had to go, the library.

I burst through the double doors, tears blurring my eyesight, immediately bumping into something that knocked me backwards.

“TARA!” It was Celeste. We both were on the floor, knocked over from the force of the collision. I rolled over and held Celeste, tears running down my face and my hands balled up into fists. I was shaking so hard I couldn’t even open my fingers. The only feeling left in my body was a muted pins and needles sensation in my finger tips.

“Tara…. Ta\- Tara!” I focused on Celeste's face as she pulled me up into a sitting position. “I came straight here. I knew these fuckers would do something like this eventually. I’ve heard so many slimy officials talking about the way this station is over packed, run wild with people living off the authorities. I just didn’t know it would be this bad.”

I just stared at her. I couldn’t comprehend this situation, still feeling like I was in a dream. She jumped up and sat down at a computer, typing furiously.

“A couple of us from my department have been working on creating an cyber loophole, one that transmits messages to the past. We figured one day it could be useful. We need to send a warning that our station is doing this. From the research I’ve done, I believe it will transmit the message sometime in the mid 2000s, it should post the message to a forum of some kind... hopefully one that is frequently viewed. If we get through it could alter the present. We could save lives, Tara.”

“If we change the past what will change in the present?” I stuttered, realization dawning on me. and the feeling of dread gnawing my stomach.

Celeste slowly blinked up from the computer screen and looked into my eyes.

“Everything. Everything might change.”

8nt9zt,PUBG_Oreoree,Dev Letter - Upcoming Fixes and Features,PUBGXboxOne,57702,221,221,0,194,2,"Hi players,

&amp;nbsp;

This is a follow-up to our recent dev letter - Addressing Player Concerns.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ve received a lot of feedback from players that you’d like us to be more frequent and transparent with our communication. We’ve heard you loud and clear!

&amp;nbsp;

That’s why today, we want to expand upon that post and share more detailed information regarding current issues, their status, and what we’re doing to get them resolved.

&amp;nbsp;

This is going to be a long read, we’ve got a lot of information to share.

&amp;nbsp;

Our dev team has expanded, and continues to expand in real-time, which will accelerate the rate of development. This hasn’t happened overnight and we’ll continue to expand our dev team over time.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ll continue working to improve the game as fast as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

With that said, let’s get started!

&amp;nbsp;

**Patch ETA**

The next patch is planned to release on June 5th. We may push this patch out earlier. If a critical issue arises, we may delay the update. We haven’t generally given specific dates until we’re completely confident with them, leading to a lot of frustration. Please understand that we want to share important dates as soon as possible, but we also don’t want to disappoint you by giving you a date which may change.

&amp;nbsp;

**Patch Info**

The next patch, currently planned for June 5th, will include fixes for GameHub stats not updating, as well as a fix for a common cause of crashing. We’ll also be implementing improvements to Elastic Accuracy Control for Characters (EACC), a system we recently introduced to reduce crashing and lag in heavily populated areas. We’ll detail EACC more later on in this post. There will also be improvements to our Prediction-based level streaming (PBLS) system, which we’ll also elaborate on.

&amp;nbsp;

There are many issues that need to be fixed in regard to performance, stability and gameplay. Some will take more time than others. We’re working hard to address all issues that can negatively affect your gameplay experience, as quickly as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ll share more information about what will be included in the next patch as we get closer to its release.

&amp;nbsp;

**Now, we will detail some of the most important, and common player concerns.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Stability (Crashing / Dashboarding)**

There are various reasons crashes can occur and we are working hard on fixing them all. Until the most recent patch, the instances of crashes experienced by players was decreasing each time we patched the game.

&amp;nbsp;

The recent patch has increased instances of crashing for many players.  This is unacceptable.

&amp;nbsp;

We’re currently working on fixing the two most common causes of crashing, with the first being fixed in the next patch:

&amp;nbsp;

1. We introduced some back-end changes to prepare for an upcoming feature and in some cases, the game would try to interact with this unfinished feature, causing the game to crash.
 
2. A crash is occurring in relation to caching memory, which is used to improve performance. We’ve been actively addressing this issue since December, steadily reducing the instances of crashes related to this each patch. We are focusing on resolving this problem entirely by the end of June.

&amp;nbsp;

As players have noticed, crashes and lag happen more often in highly populated areas.To combat this, on top of our standard ongoing performance and stability work, we recently introduced a system designed specifically to improve performance and reduce crashes in highly populated areas.

&amp;nbsp;

Previously, we handled character resources in full for everyone that was near the player, within a 1km radius. This was causing lag/FPS drops and crashes at the early stages of the game after landing, as too many resources were being handled all at once, in populated areas. We have been working on introducing a dynamic system for these specific situations and have implemented a system called “Elastic Accuracy Control for Character, or EACC. Each resource was refreshed at a constant rate within 1km radius of your player. When characters were picking up items, changing clothes etc, this was causing all items within the 1km radius to be refreshed.

&amp;nbsp;

We made this system dynamic with EACC. It will now work depending on many factors, mainly distance. It will handle resources (refresh resources faster or slower) depending on those factors.

&amp;nbsp;

Much like PBLS, with each patch, EACC will become more effective at improving performance and in turn reducing crashes, as we gather more data each patch cycle and our engineers implement improvements based on the analysis of that data.

&amp;nbsp;

**Map Selection**

Map selection is still in development, we’ve still got some further work to do and we’ll get this out to you as soon as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

**World Rendering (Loading)**

The rendering (loading) process is different in each match, for each player, in each location. We need to find the best process to load resources in all scenarios, for every player. As mentioned in our previous dev letter, we’re using a system called prediction-based level streaming (PBLS) to speed up the rendering process. Our engineers are adjusting and optimizing this system every patch, based on data accumulated during that patch cycle.

&amp;nbsp;

PBLS is used specifically when parachuting, as it uses a lot of resources which can cause lower FPS for players. We use a different non-prediction-based level streaming system while on the ground, as it is more efficient.

&amp;nbsp;

When parachuting and falling through the air, a lot more resources have to be loaded than when you’re moving in on the ground. Imagine a chessboard as our map, with each square representing a square on our map. Your character occupies a square on that chessboard while on the ground and the game will load three squares in front of you (in a T shape), as your movement is somewhat predictable—we know where you’re going.

&amp;nbsp;

This is much different when in the air, parachuting. When you’re parachuting and falling towards the ground, everything around you has to be loaded, because we can’t predict where you will go. Instead of having to only load three squares in front of you, an area of 3x3 squares around you will have to be loaded. With PBLS, this system intuitively decides where in that 3x3 area to load first, to improve rendering times in the area where you’re going to land.

&amp;nbsp;

As you all know, there are often problems with rendering happening too slowly when driving vehicles, where buildings can suddenly appear in front of you, or you can get stuck inside a building which didn’t appear to be there previously. We have a level streaming system (separate from our prediction-based system) which is used while on the ground specifically, this system will load resources that you’re heading towards and instantly dump resources far behind you to improve performance. When travelling at high speeds, rendering can often not happen quickly enough, and we’re working to improve this system.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ll be making adjustments to level-streaming, further taking into account vehicle speed to improve the process of rendering resources you want to see and dumping those that are no longer needed.

&amp;nbsp;

For both our predictive and regular level-streaming systems, our engineers will be making improvements each patch to improve their efficiency and improve rendering times, after analyzing data from the patch cycle.

&amp;nbsp;

**Server Performance**

At the start of each match, the server is under the most stress due to having to keep track of 100 players all at once. We’ve recently applied some network improvements to the PC servers to help alleviate some early game load and we’re working to push these optimizations to Xbox as soon as possible, once they’re proven to be stable.

&amp;nbsp;

We’re constantly working on improving server performance, this is an ongoing process.

&amp;nbsp;

**Vehicles**

There are many bumps and sharp terrain geometry around the maps which can cause vehicles to explode in situations you wouldn’t expect and this is, obviously, extremely frustrating. We’re working to smooth out the terrain on all maps and reduce instances of these frustrating situations.

&amp;nbsp;

We expect to push some of these improvements later in June.

&amp;nbsp;

**Other important issues we’re investigating**     


This list doesn’t include all issues we’re investigating, but these are some of issues being discussed the most:

&amp;nbsp;

1. Player teleports to a different location after vaulting
2. Match not ending, as the game believes another player is still alive, even though you cannot see anyone else in the final circle
3. Vehicles flipping or exploding for seemingly no reason
4. GameHub stats not updating - This will be fixed in the next patch. All of these stats have been tracked since the May update, but just haven’t yet been reflected in the GameHub. GameHub stats will not be restored instantly, but over time. Once the patch goes live, we’ll keep you updated through the process.

&amp;nbsp;

While we work to fix these bugs, optimization and stability are still our top priorities. We have different teams who work on different aspects of development, based on their skill sets and experience.

&amp;nbsp;

We will continue to address bugs, while improving performance and stability.

&amp;nbsp;

----

&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully this post has answered your questions and addressed concerns you may have.

&amp;nbsp;

If you have any other questions that we haven’t yet answered, please leave a comment and Hawkinz or myself will do our best to provide an answer.

&amp;nbsp;

We again want to take this opportunity to apologize for our lack of communication and delay in addressing key community concerns.

&amp;nbsp;

We’re actively working to improve our communication with the community and provide updates as often as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

8nrzqf,KeffirLime,"You're not unlucky, You're just Lazy",TheRedPill,268907,322,322,0,51,0,"Recently I’ve begun to notice an alarming trend. The rise of the male hamster. A little rodent that runs around chewing away at any rationale, and shits out little excuses as to why things aren’t going the way you want.

Females get away with not holding themselves to a particular standard, because they don’t have to, their biology doesn’t dictate it. It’s often not directly linked to their success in the sexual market. A women can fail at almost anything and blame pretty much everyone and everything for it, but, because she has a great pair of tits and her ass is borderline splitting her jeans, she’s absolved. She remains at the top of her sexual Hierarchy. 

Men on the other hand do not escape with such a privilege. A man’s place in the Sexual hierarchy is directly linked to his successes and failures. His status matters. What he has to offer matters. The male hamster becomes a really dangerous little fucker when men start holding themselves to a feminine standard. When they start spawning every excuse in the book to justify their failures.  

Im going to tell you **A tale of 3 friends**:

**Friend 1** - Friend one is a great looking guy, he’s well built, has a decent paying job, lives in a nice apartment. You’d say he’s in the top 1% of mate selection, here’s the catch, he hardly ever gets a whiff of pussy. And when he does he settles for Moby Dicks little cousin. One could call him Captain Ahab. He claims his struggles with women are because he’s not wealthy, not a male model, Isn’t a famous IG celebrity.

**Friend 2** – Friend two is a bit different. He’s an overweight middle aged man, face like a pug, if you saw him in the street you’d probably expect him to collect your garbage. Friend two, however, needs a pair of armbands when he goes out, because he quite literally drowns in it. He came from a poor background but is now very wealthy, and a well-known member of society, He’s built up an events company from scratch in his younger years that brings down some of the biggest names in electronic music.

**Friend 3** - Friend three is the one I find most interesting. He’s very similar to friend one, good looking, well built, earns less than no.1, but is improving every year, He stays in a shittier apartment. Friend 3 is charming, could sell ice to eskimos, and is driven, he’s constantly improving, I believe in a few years’ time he will be very successful. Friend 3 takes home girls like a Hugh Hefner slumber party. He’s plated multiple models, and could take a fresh cut of fillet home every week if he so desired.

Now you’re probably wondering what the difference between these fellows is apart from the obvious, and I’ll drop you a hint, **2 of them own their shit**, make the most of their situation, and one of them sits around all day pissing into the wind about every reason why he’s not where he wants to be.

You have two options in life, you can be a log in the ocean getting crashed around, merciless to the tides around you. Blame your finances, or genetics, or the fact that your mom never packed lunch for you. Or you can build a boat, use the tools at your disposal to build a highly functional, bad ass machine. Then you can plot your journey, navigate the seas and the weathers to get wherever the fuck you want to be.

8nobqf,pnw-trash,I changed the mind of a very stubborn woman at my work,loseit,854276,2648,2648,0,119,0,"There’s someone at my work that’s extremely overweight to the point of walking with a cane and having procedures done on her joints. She has a 2 year old son and she can barely handle just walking near him. She also has a gluten issue and thinks that because of it, she’s already avoiding most carbs and doesn’t need to diet. Fat is a “genetic” thing for her. 

I’ve lost 30+ pounds since February 1st and she noticed a month or so ago. She asked what I was doing, and I told her about CICO. She told me I looked great, but that she’d “starve” on that diet because she avoids gluten all day. I’m really non-confrontational so I just thanked her and moved on. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago and she noticed that I had a donut AND a bagel at work (lol it was great). She said “Aren’t you on a low calorie thing? How can you eat that?” and I explained that I’m eating light veggies that evening to make room for it. I also took that moment to tell her how with a careful diet, I can eat 1000 calories over my minimum and still have weight loss (my TDEE is about 2300). She was kind of speechless. 

Then today, she comes to my desk and thanks me. She said I inspired her, she downloaded a calorie counting app, and lost TEN POUNDS! I was a little flustered when she told me but I cried on the way home. I’m so proud to have impacted her life and hopefully her son’s if she keeps it up.

However it is ALL thanks to this sub and /r/1200isplenty. You have given me tools to succeed and now that is trickling to others in my life, and their family members. Please give yourselves a pat on the back for me! Thank you forever for all of your positive contributions to this community ❤️❤️❤️ 

**UPDATE:** I asked her today if it would be ok for me to send her a list of low cal recipes, snacks, tips, and foods to avoid. She was ELATED. I will post what I give her later today! She also said she’s excellent at replacing gluten so if I sneak a few ingredients that have it, she can take care of it. 

I also want to say thanks again for all of your support. You guys are truly too sweet. ",False,False,6.0,1527820066.0,1527436599.8321111,-383466.1678888798

8nq4i7,TouchableGoose,"CMV: As an American, I shouldn't be obligated to participate in the national anthem as a display to prove my allegiance to my country.",changemyview,573233,895,895,0,240,0,"If you asked the average American how they feel about participating in the national anthem, I think your average person would say that they couldn't be bothered by it. All you do is stand when they ask you stand, take off your hat, place your hand over your heart, face the flag, and to keep doing it for another minute and a half.

Why? What exactly does our national anthem symbolize? ""Well it symbolizes freedom,"" some say. At the same time others will tell you that by participating in the anthem you are paying tribute to our troops, or to those who lost their lives defending our flag and its values. Some will say it's a culmination of the two and then a couple other things. And then there are the people who have no idea to what the hell the anthem is supposed to mean, and stand there out of mere social compliance. The last scenario is particularly concerning, because not only are there people blindly pledging their allegiance to ideals they're oblivious to, but some people do it simply to avoid being ostracized by the more radically patriotic members of our society. I find this particularly irritating.

The first issue, which I've already touched upon, is not everyone can definitively agree on what or what not the anthem represents. I'd argue that often times the anthem is a projection of an individual's own subjective opinion of what they believe it represents. Not every American looks through the same lens. Some people love America because of its opportunities, others for its values, its ideologies, its culture\-\-the list goes on. The fact that we all have our own reasons to why we love or even hate America means that standing \(or kneeling\) for the national anthem is going to bear different levels of significance for different people.

The second issue, which is the more important issue at hand, is that refusing to participate in the national anthem is seen as abhorrent, unpatriotic behavior. Some people go as far as saying that by not participating in the national anthem that you somehow hate America. Really? You're telling me that by not going through the mundane motions of the same old song\-and\-dance that I've done a thousand times, that I hate my own country? Maybe you could argue that I'm not a true patriot in the traditional sense, and probably that's true, but I'd argue that my right to choose whether or not I wish to participate in the anthem is the epitome of American values.

Whenever you think about America, the term 'freedom' probably comes to the forefront, but for me that isn't always the case. Often I feel our social and cultural atmosphere dictates a vast amount of our behaviors in ways we are unaware of, and in some cases\-\-like the one I'm trying to highlight\-\-can impede on our individual liberties. I shouldn't be harassed just because I don't want to participate in what feels like an out\-dated, almost cult\-like tradition. As a child going through primary school, it always seemed odd to me that I had to pledge my allegiance to a piece of fabric every single morning before class could even begin. It wasn't until around middle school that I had finally decided I was no longer going to participate in the strange ritual. I remember the first time a teacher of mine noticed me protesting the pledge. She stopped the entire class just to scold me and try to force me to participate. When I refused, I was immediately punished and given detention. The idea that I was being punished for not participating in the obsessive utterance of these words was ludicrous to me even as a twelve\-year\-old. In spite of this, my contentious behavior on the matter continued throughout my high school years, and along the entire way I was met with friction by my teachers enforcing me to participate. Now this behavior was admittedly partially due to my rebellious disposition at the time, but mostly the idea that I had to align myself to a certain set of values and then pledge my so\-called allegiance to said values felt inherently wrong to me.

Now this begs the question: Is there such a thing as 'forced\-patriotism', and does it inhibit our individual liberties? I think it does, but not it ways that are obvious. This idea of patriotism is imposed on us at such an early age, that we become indoctrinated into this artificial ideal, where we often go through the motions without truly thinking about why we do them. Now I'm not saying that if you participate in the national anthem to show your patriotism that you're some brain\-washed drone blindly adhering to an out\-dated tradition. If the national anthem has meaning to you, and participating in it brings you joy, then by all means do it \(Insert Shia LaBeouf here\). But don't insist that I adhere to an idea that I don't believe in, as that is the most un\-American thing you could do to a person.",False,False,6.0,1527839215.0,1527436599.8321111,-402615.1678888798

Now, before you start ranting, hear me out. Fortnite has Thanos in it. Thanos is in Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite.  Mega Man X is in Marvel vs. Capcom, and Mega Man X in the same universe as Mega Man, since Dr. Light created both of them. Mega Man is in Smash Bros, and so is Pac Man, who appears in Wreck-it Ralph. One scene in Wreck-it Ralph shows a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have a comic book crossover with Batman. Scooby Doo and the Mystery Gang show up in an episode of Batman. Scooby Doo, of course, has a crossover with Johnny Bravo. Johnny Bravo is in an obscure Smash Bros. ripoff for the Wii, called Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion. All three Powerpuff Girls show up in this game.

8nr0ql,JaxJyls,Noobs derail Boss Fight,DnDGreentext,119256,460,460,0,33,0,"Long Time Reader, First Time Poster so here goes

&gt;The group of newcomers to DnD, including me playing 5e

&gt;Party consists of 2 elven rogues (One of which is me), an elven wizard played by a slightly more experienced player and a human fighter that we elves all bully. We are all around level 2 -3.

&gt;Sent to go clear a cave of kobolds

&gt;Despite having 2 rogues, we trigger a trap that alerts everybody of our presence.

&gt;Party bumbles into a group kobolds welding bottles full of dangerous liquids

&gt;We manage to make short of them regardless and wipe the group except one Kobold who our wizard managed to charm

&gt; The kobold turned out to have extremely helpful information, telling us of what opposition to expect, directions through the cave and locations of traps

&gt; We made our way to the room just outside where we knew the boss resided

&gt; That's when we had a crazy idea

&gt; Send the charmed kobold in and try to convince the boss to come out alone

DM chuckles and goes with it

&gt; Charmed Kobold enters the boss room and hear mutterings from the room beyond.

DM rolls a couple of times for the charmed Kobold (who has rather low charisma), and sighs audibly

&gt; Meanwhile the party all attempt to hide and prepare an ambush, 

&gt; Rogues obviously hide perfectly well, wizard manages to find a good hiding place and our token human with disadvantaged stealth rolls a 10

&gt; The kobold with the close-to-ending charmed status soon returns quickly followed by an intimidating kobold sorcerer, and no one else.

DM nows rolls for the sorcerer's perception, clearly expecting to spot our clumsy human. This time he sighs and facepalms

&gt; Sorcerer does not notice anything amiss before we all spring our trap

&gt; Less than a round of sneak attacks later both kobolds are dead before they could even react

8nr8lr,carpool,"Chris Cao's responses to ""The Economy"" post",MagicArena,19769,394,394,0,248,0,"Like many of you, I was extremely disappointed with ""The Economy Post"". After 3 weeks of anticipation I was expecting solutions, not a post echoing many of our concerns.

However; after reading all of Chris Cao's responses I feel a lot better about it (he said many of our concerns are being worked on), so I have curated the responses here for easy reading. I may have missed some, so you can get the [original sources, context, and latest posts here](https://mtgarena.community.gl/forums/devTracker).

\*\*\*

*1\) First off, thanks for all the feedback so far. It probably sounds weird to hear me say that so often. Or maybe it comes off too PR\-ish. But I say it because it's my core value as a dev: be fueled by feedback.*

*Second, I agree the original post is way too long \(we're changing how we do this going forward\). And, I can see how it didn't satisfy some core elements of our conversation.*

*So let me write some more text \(😁\) in the hopes I can share what underlies all of this.*

*On the window of my office is a big sign that says, 'We are the players who change the game.' There's a lot of ways to read that. We're literally the players who make changes to the game. We're the players who are always looking for ways to improve the game. We're the players who are offering a whole new way to view and experience MTG. We are the players who are responsible for balancing change.*

*The most important part of the sign is that we are players, first and foremost. So, as a player, let me tell you my story of play:*

*No one at Wizards gets free stuff in MTG Arena. We play for it or we pay for it with our own money. We do this because we can't stay close to what our audience is experiencing without experiencing it ourselves. We recognize our bias as devs, but we want our experience to match yours as much as possible.*

*My account was wiped and I started playing purely FTP.*

*Immediately, I felt the angst of not knowing when I'd get my next WC as did a lot of people on the team. A lot of you felt this more acutely. We have a big change to the Vault coming in July to address this.*

*I played a bunch the first day, got my 3 packs, and felt pretty good.*

*When I played the next day without the packs, I felt like 4 wins and then no rewards sucked. I wanted to play more and the game was telling me to stop. I knew we still wanted to balance the time FTP had to play to get max value, but this felt too short. We have a change for this in June.*

*I played a bunch of Quick Constructed and it felt better than just the ladder. My opponents were playing for stakes, and it made better games. I was playing for stakes and it made me up my game.*

*I started saving for the first draft. The timer was maddening because it told me how far away draft was, not how close it was. We're changing how we present things in June. It's a small change, but it's an improvement.*

*Friday morning, I jumped into draft the first minute is was open. And I went 0 and 3. It was over in 20 minutes, including the draft. Clearly, I suck at draft. It wasn't fun for me. But, from the participation and feedback, it was also clear a lot of people loved it and we got a lot of feedback about pricing/rewards/AI picks. We learned.*

*I went back to my FTP for about another week, earning packs and ICR's. The WC angst stuck with me, and I knew we had to make bigger changes to the WC system overall.*

*I decided to spend $100 on gems and get the other end of the experience. It was a lot of fun to open packs 10 at a time and see my Vault fill\-up. I didn't have WC angst. I net decked a G/R Monsters deck for about $70 plus the FTP cards I'd earned. I had leftovers. But my experience with FTP told me we had to bring more to the free play end of the spectrum.*

*I played Quick Constructed and had a lot of fun. It became my primary mode. But, it was clear from your feedback and our play we needed an experience that matched folks based on general deck strength rather than just win rate. We're doing that for July.*

*I've played mostly Quick Constructed ever since, bouncing to the ladder to play Rat Colony, Explore, and Knight decks for fun and to get my daily value. But, the 4 wins thing still felt bad.*

*My vault got to 80\% or so, and I decided to spend another $20 on packs to pop it and get the WC's I wanted. It felt good, but, others on the team who were just playing FTP \(and a lot of you\) said it was, 1\) the only sure way to get WC's, and 2\) too far away. We're changing that for July.*

*I've been playing since then with a variety of decks, getting better \(I think\), and enjoying playing with all of you. Many times I played, I wished we could get some of the key July changes in for June because of what they bring.*

*I've shared this because I think it can help the conversation. We're playing, we're reading, and we're always discussing the cross\-over of feedback and our own play experience. And we're changing the game based on all of that.*

*From your feedback, it's clear a lot of posters don't think this is the case. My best response to that is to share our experiences, improve how we message our choices \(no more late monster posts\), and play the game with all of you so our conversations are based on the same experiences.*

*We will get you more information about the important changes I mentioned as soon as we've play tested them and are confident in them. Let's keep the conversation, and the change it drives, going.*

*Thanks for all your play and feedback.*

\*\*\*

*2\) I forgot to mention another important part of my play story: The Vault contribution of 5\+ felt bad, especially for Rares and Mythics. We had discussed just changing the amount contributed, but, based on play and feedback, we realized we needed a bigger change than that. We're aiming for July with that change too.*

\*\*\*

*3\) We're aiming for the next round of changes to come with July. They are mainly focused on the areas I mentioned. As we play test, we'll let you all know more rather than waiting for a wall of text.*

\*\*\*

*4\) That wasn't my intention, but I appreciate the feedback. My drive is to experience what we've made as legitimately as I can \(while still being a dev\). There's a spectrum to that experience, and I'm sharing what I felt along the way.*

\*\*\*

*5\) Nice name! Need some nachos now.*

*I posted it elsewhere, but I wanted to mention here that we are making bigger changes to the 5\+ issue. And I too have opened a lot of full gray boosters and felt the disappointment.*

*I also hear you on the extra Common/Uncommon WC's. We've added more Uncommon cards through ICR's based on feedback and metrics to give constructed events more spice. For July, the WC system changes we're building now \(but that still need testing\) will help this, but we are still working on an actual solution for the specific issue.*

\*\*\*

*6\) To touch briefly on the new player experience, we have been working on various parts of this for awhile now and testing it with different groups of players, both internally and externally. Due to MTG's depth, there's a lot we can do here overtime to help more CCG players fall in love with all the game has to offer. We'll start with the basics and improve from there as we see how it helps, or doesn't help, new players. I don't have a specific date just yet for our first draft.*

\*\*\*

*7\) Thanks for this, pollux. It's a really good distillation. I'll definitely need to think more about some of it more, but I appreciate that you laid it out, good and bad.*

*The, 'Magic depth,' line clearly didn't communicate what we were after. There's a lot more to discuss on the topic of competitive goals, but I will say our main goal is to be competitive both in terms of FTP time and real money with the leaders in the digital CCG space. We wanted to give out some of the numbers we're using to show you where we are at so you all could make your own comparisons. This line was trying to convey that MTG has a much bigger variance in the composition of its decks than the other leaders as far as rarity goes. That means, it can take more time to earn some decks based on how many more Rares or Mythics they have. We clearly could've said that more clearly.*

*Grinding is really interesting. I've made several MMO's and played even more, so I know well the desire to get into that grind state of mind. The trick for us is that we also want to make it so people who don't want to grind \(but do want to play for free\) can keep up. The changes we've made are aimed at extending out the games you can play and feel rewarded, not necessarily at supporting long grinds. It's not a perfect balance by any means, but I wanted to share what we're aiming at.*

*We talked a lot about selling WC's directly, and we've decided that the first issue we need to clear up is the fact that you can't plan/drive for your deck goals because there's no path ahead. We're testing ways to drastically reduce WC variance and make the path super clear. To be honest, we know now that WC's coming primarily from packs or a long term thing like the Vault hides their value too much and makes them undependable for the players' needs.*

*The KLD grant actually comes from the fact that we're putting sets into the game much faster than it was designed to handle \(from an experience standpoint\). People are still playing to get the Dominaria decks they want \(it's only been a little over a month\), and we wanted folks to be able to play Standard ASAP. With Bo3, we're adding the real competitive level to the game, and we wanted folks to be able to get to it quickly and enjoy it.*

*Thanks again. Good stuff.*

\*\*\*

*8\) Yeah, walls of text can bury the key facts. I don't want to get too specific until we've play tested because it'll be speculative, but here's a couple specifics to surface in the body of the thread. We'll find other ways to make them more clear to everyone:*

*WC's need to be more deterministic so we can plan our decks/see our destination. They aren't motivating right now because of their variance. We're aiming at July for a fix.*

*The Vault got overloaded with concepts. 5\+ copies of cards and pack opening rewards aren't really the same thing. We're splitting these into two different ideas. We'll let you know how it works out as we play test.*

*5\+ copies of cards understandably felt to a lot of people like a dust system. We weren't really after that, but it's clear now that it's confusing. Most importantly, it sucks to open gray packs and not get any real feeling of progression/rewards July is our target.*

*I've replied to a few other threads with these kinds of details, but I'll ask our community folks to pull a better summary together because, yeah, we need to tell folks this stuff.*

\*\*\*

*9\) There's a lot of feedback about the way we're communicating things and the motivations we have. I chose this post mainly to make sure to engage in the full spectrum of feedback as it shares those themes with other posts. In the actions vs. words department, my goal here is to use some words to actively engage the sentiments shared.*

*We've set our goals to be competitive and shared our numbers so you all can make up your own minds. The digital CCG space has exploded, and there's a wide range of values out there. We've aimed to compete with the top because we know how to lead in the CCG space on tabletop. Now, we want to bring that to digital.*

*Some games will take less time to earn. Some will take more. MTG has a wider range of possible deck earn times because of its depth and diversity, but we've aimed with our math to compete.*

*We've made some different choices \(WC's\) to explore different spaces than others, and it can make the comparisons more difficult. We also need to make that value more clear in game, and that's what our July fixes are aimed at. Your feedback and play is driving these changes.*

*Thanks to everyone who shared their frustration, anger, doubt, and passion. When I say thanks for the feedback, good or bad, I mean it.*

*Thanks.*

\*\*\*

*10\) Thanks for the feedback, Blue. I think this is another case where we didn't clearly communicate what we were after. Let me try to state it better.*

*We want to offer packs, events, cosmetics, and other cool stuff we haven't come up with yet for gems. We made some bundles at different price points that line up with those different offerings. Part of the problem is that we rolled out only packs at first, so there was a mismatch between the gem bundles and the pack bundles. Folks reacted to that mismatch, which is completely understandable. We didn't give you all the whole picture.*

*As more offerings become available, it'll become more clear that the gem bundles are general price points that you can use on different combinations of things. That's where we were going with the line you quoted, but it clearly didn't convey what we wanted.*

*On a related note, others have asked why we don't just use dollars for pricing. This is because we wanted to give all players a path to gem\-only offerings. There will be events and cosmetics that are gem only. MTG has a much bigger range of possible experiences than many other CCG's, and we've built our economy to account for that range.*

*Others have asked why we don't have just one currency. The gems answer above is a large part of it. Another part of it is that we wanted some events, like Quick Draft to give out a kind of value that other events don't give out. Rather than just vary the amount needed, we wanted to make some events even more rewarding because they unlock gem\-only experiences.*

*There's a lot of good feedback on this topic and we need to do more to communicate our goals clearly. Take this as a start, and expect us to continue this part of the conversation in the coming weeks.*

*Thanks again for the feedback and helping us clear this up.*

\*\*\*

*11\) We agree that our hype of the post, and the length of the post itself, was too much. We wanted to address the major themes in the economy discussion broadly after the April reset. But, we tried to do to much with one post, and thus it made it take much longer to get it out to all of you.*

*We should've set expectations better. And written less.  😀*

\*\*\*

*12\) Thanks, TomDW, for bringing up a good point of needed clarification. One of the results of a rarity\-based economy is that it does tend to narrow the decks people drive towards to what is perceived as the best. And, if winning in established events is the main way to earn value, then there's even more pressure to lower deck diversity.*

*We've been talking with the tabletop design leadership about this throughout beta, and it's a top topic in our design meetings. MTG has a lot more depth/fun than just playing the tip of what win\-based Standard formats has to offer. We're experimenting internally with some event ideas to use ICR's to give rewards to folks who are coloring outside the lines of the defined meta, but do so in a way that helps them build those creative decks they love. We don't have a solid version to share yet, but you are 100\% right. We need something to take full advantage of what MTG offers.*

\*\*\*

*13\) Thanks, ixSci, for helping me clarify this a bit further. We don't generally comment on other developer's games directly for a variety of reasons, but I understand your question, especially since we've been talking about competitive earn rates. Let me see if I can make things more clear while still focusing on MTG Arena.*

*I'm going to start in an odd place, but stay with me. Wild Cards let us give out more value because we can give away the, 'dust,' value \(the ability to get the specific cards you want\) AND extra cards. We can also use cards much more frequently as individual rewards because they don't all turn into dust.*

*But we need to do a MUCH better job of messaging all of that in game. That's where July's changes come in. Dust is predictable. WC's currently aren't. This isn't just a UX change we're play testing. This is a fundamental change to the variance with which we distribute WC's. We're moving a lot more of the value to a place where folks can depend on it.*

*Now, back to the main point. We want our baseline to be competitive \(e.g. daily earn rate\). But, giving out more individual cards is generally extra value on top of that as are event rewards. In other words, we give out even more rewards in the form of these cards and the extra gold you can win with skill.*

*We understand that some folks dismiss the value of ICR's all together because of their variance. But, they do have value, and we give out a lot of them to help mitigate that variance some. Our goal is for our baseline to be competitive with the leaders, and then to reward even more through ICR's and skill\-based rewards.*

*Thanks again for the clarifying questions.*

\*\*\*

*14\) Thanks, Apex. I mentioned it in another response, but we do need to find ways to embrace MTG's deck diversity while still using the rarity\-based economy. We don't have a solution to present to you all yet, but it's a top topic with tabletop design and our design team.*

*To your pricing question, we're looking at it more form the perspective of how to give away more packs for play rather than change fundamental pricing outright. I realized in reading your post that I've been saying, 'free,' a lot when I mean, 'play.' The reason I want to clarify this is that we do value player's time \(the intent of our daily reward structure\), but we do want people to play MTG to earn the rewards as that's the most satisfying way to feel the reward of your accomplishments.*

Police say a mummified body found in a house in Sydney's lower North Shore this week is a ""mystery"".

Strike Force Grimmett was established between North Shore Local Area Command and Homicide Squad detectives to investigate the ""unique"" death at what police described as a ""hoarder's house"" in Greenwich.

Police are treating the discovery of a mummified body of a man on Sydney's lower north shore as suspicious.

Cleaners made the gruesome discovery on Tuesday after they were sent to the house following the death of owner Bruce Roberts last year.

They called police who are yet to formally identify the victim, a man in his 30s or 40s from NSW.

It is understood the victim was known to police.

Investigators are now looking at a number of lines of investigation, including whether the person's death predates that of Mr Roberts, whether Mr Roberts was involved in his death or whether the victim had been reported as a missing person.

""It is a mystery, and we need to take the time to investigate,"" acting Superintendent Simon Jones said.

""We must treat the death as suspicious. It is believed the body has been in the home for a considerable time. The body was covered in an amount of material.""

He said that, despite the decomposition of the body, it was evident the person had sustained ""a number of injuries"".

Mr Roberts was also known to police before his death.

The nature of his hoarding has made the search more challenging for investigators, he said.

""There have been a number of items seized from the home.

""It's highly unusual. We don't get many jobs like this.""

A worker at the local IGA told Fairfax Media that, when Mr Roberts failed to come into the shop for his groceries every day last July, they became concerned and alerted police who found him dead in the house close to a heater.

Mr Roberts had ""hoarder"" tendencies and was quite reclusive.

Long-time neighbour Gayle Meagher recalled exchanging pleasantries with him.

""He was a bit of a recluse,"" she told the ABC on Thursday.

8nqjq3,Sanibunani,It's World Milk Day. Let's pay tribute to all the suffering cow mothers and their calfs have to face.,vegan,194750,881,881,0,86,0,"1. The cow is artificially inseminated. That means some weird ass farmer puts his hand into the mother cow and inseminates her (or it can be done with a machine I think). This is essentially rape.

2. Then the cow of course gets pregnant and after around 380 days gives birth to her calf.
Now (and shortly before the birth) the cows hormones (like mothers of the homo sapiens) kick in and she produces milk to nourish the calf.

3. But this milk is (in the eyes of the farmer - and the happy customers) not meant for the calf so the baby cow must be eliminated from the equation. The farmers (brutally) take the calf from her mother, and the mother cow understands it (!!). She moans after her lost offspring and shows other such indicators of loss and sadness.

4. The mother cow now can be milked without the calf around and this process is accelerated with hormones and selective breeding. The milk cows are usually milk all at once, so the farmers wait till their teats grow big and full which is very painful for the mammals.

5a. This process is repeated for the mother until it's productivity in producing that milky goodness drops to that extend in which the cost is more then the profit. Then she is killed.

5b. The calf is if it's a male raised as veal (which is a whole new level of horror - esentially: **extremely** short confinement, dark place the whole life and iron deficiancy). If it's not raised as veal then it is still raised to be slaughtered (the usual way)
If the calf us female the follows her mother foot steps.

And all this is done in short confinement, little relief and in total disregard of the fundamental needs of the animals.",False,False,6.0,1527845059.0,1527436599.8321111,-408459.1678888798

In short I was in a horrible place in my head and when I boarded the cab I was already crying (not the kind that you can discreetly hide lol I was outright sobbing already). Instead of probing he gave me a pack of tissues then we started talking about why I was crying.

At the end of my trip I realised they don't take card or NETS so I said I will get his number and make a bank transfer in the next 10 minutes since I don't usually carry cash around. This is my fault because I should've asked if he took card/NETS as payment before I boarded. However the driver uncle told me he will waive the fee and even offered to drive over to the coffee shop 5 mins away to get me a cold drink.

I couldn't accept his offer (and started crying more bc I didn't expect such kindness after a really shitty week) and gave him all the cash I had, which didn't even amount to half the trip fee. I'm glad he accepted it and I'm glad I met + spoke to him.

I still hate myself for not getting his name and car plate number so I can make a formal compliment to the cab company.

Before I left he said, life is always about balance and ups and downs, see girl, you had such a bad week but now you meet me and i'm good!

8ns9rt,Skeddies,Kratos will not die permanently you loonies(/spoiler),GodofWar,46932,197,197,0,53,0,"Think outside the box my people - throughout all of the GoW games, Kratos shows that he is unbound by fate and is always flipping prophecies upside down and inside out - this has been set as a big part of his story since the Greek pantheon. It's silly to think that because Kratos is depicted dying in a mural, that he is going to stay dead. SILLY I TELL YOU.


Faye foresaw this whole game, that's true. The giants' mural *does* show Kratos dying. With Faye being correct this whole game, why wouldn't we believe the giants' mural? Well sit your **sweet ass** down because I'll tell ya why we shouldn't *fully* believe that mural. Think about it: If the giants' foresight was absolute, they would not be in the position that they are in now. In fact, nothing would ever go wrong for the giants as a race if their foresight was so powerful. However, every story that Mimir tells about the giants ends very poorly for them.

This mixed with the fact that Kratos is always dicking up everyone's plans, prophecies, and fates, I highly doubt that Kratos will actually die and stay dead.

In my opinion, Kratos may very well die, but I believe that he will do it on purpose, hence the word ""deceit"" in the mural. *But why would he die on purpose?!* Because in Norse mythology, when you die in battle, you are brought to Asgard, which we can safely assume Kratos will travel to in one way or another.


Furthermore, I highly doubt that the Valkyries were in the game just to serve as optional bosses. The Valkyries were in this game for a reason. We released the Valkyries from their corrupted forms in this game, which means that if and when Kratos dies in the next game, the Valkyries will bring him to Asgard. I believe that if Kratos dies at all, he will do it willingly as a means to get into Asgard, and will definitely not stay dead.


Here's where it gets interesting. Freya now hates Kratos and wants to parade his cold dead body throughout all of the realms. Yeesh. In Norse mythology, (if they stay true to this part), Freya has the first pick of the dead when they go to Asgard. She picks who she wants to stay in her meadow, Fólkvangr, and the other half go to the halls of Valhalla.

Whether Freya keeps him in Fólkvangr or sends him to Valhalla can be seen as sinister or helpful depending on whether they become allies again prior to Kratos' deceitful trip to Asgard...

8ns09c,Drijidible,I was a subway creep,LetsNotMeet,355247,220,220,0,10,0,"Years ago, I'd say over half a decade, I got on the subway at rush hour to head home after a long day of classes. I was exhausted, too. There are periods in my life where I can't sleep. No matter how tired I am, it takes me hours and hours to fall asleep and no matter how late I finally fall asleep I wake up well before sunrise. Repeat.

So, there I was, crushed tight in this train, everyone rubbing against each other side-by-side so we all fit in. Naturally, like any polite person, I'd taken off my bag and held it with a hand between my legs to ensure I wasn't taking up too much space. I'm spacing out -- on top of the lack of sleep I was one of those idiots who had the ""great idea"" to have a four day weekend and scheduled all my classes on two days meaning I'd just had 9 hours straight of dull lectures -- but I notice out of the corner of my eye the guy standing to my right keeps glancing at me. I don't think much of it, but he keeps doing it throughout the 10 minutes I'm riding the train.

We get to my stop, and the guy next to me's stop too. I feel a pull on my bag and quickly glance over thinking ""He's not actually trying to steal my bag, is he?"" Nope. Turns out I haven't been holding my bag at all, but I've been holding a bit of his coat sleeve this entire time, like I'm a little kid and he's my mom. By the time I realized he was speeding out the door and I couldn't even apologize.

I still blush and get embarrassed every time I think about this, to this day. I feel so sorry for this poor guy.",False,False,6.0,1527860879.0,1527436599.8321111,-424279.1678888798

YOU THINK OUR LEAGUE JUST REVOLVES AROUND FC CINCINNATI?! FOR THE MOST PART, YEAH, BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO USL THAN THEIR ATTENDANCE. 

THERE’S DONGERS, DROGBA, GARTH BROOKS, THE SIMULATION, VEGAS, COYOS, STREAMERS, FLOODING, DEAD WHALES, PENNISLANDERS, BUTTERFLIES, LLAMAS, SKYLINE, THE GHOST OF FORMER US OPEN CUP CHAMPION ROCHESTER RHINOS, AND FINALLY THE REINCARNATED ROCHESTER RHINOS NOW CALLED SACRAMENTO REPUBLIC AND, TO A MORE LITERAL EXTENT, PITTSBURGH RIVERHOUNDS.

**WAYNE ROONEY’S NEW BITCH VS THE CLUB FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE RAILHAWKS**

IS THE PRIDE OF ENGLAND GOING TO MAKE IT TO THIS MATCH? BETTER HOPE SO, BECAUSE TIYI SHIPALANE JUST RE-SIGNED WITH NCFC IN THE MOST OF IMPRESSIVE MAY/JUNE TRANSFER FOR ALL OF US SOCCER. AUDI FIELD MAY LOOK NICE NOW, BUT IT DOESN’T HOLD A CANDLE TO THE PRESTIGIOUS WAKE MED, WHERE THIS MATCH WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF. WHEN RACCOONS DREAM OF HEAVEN, THEY DREAM OF WAKE MED SOCCER PARK. DON’T FORGET WAKE MED HAS HOSTED MORE USMNT MATCHES THAN AUDI FIELD EVER WILL, PROBABLY. FOR NOW AT LEAST.

WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT PHILLY NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A DECENT STRIKER, ALONG WITH THEM BEING A PERENNIAL DISAPPOINTMENT, AND YOU KNOW WHO THEY SHOULD HAVE SIGNED? 2017 USL GOLDEN BOOT WINNER, DANE KELLY.

EVEN AFTER 4 TRANSFER WINDOWS MNTDEW UNITED STILL RESEMBLE A SECOND DIVISION TEAM. FÜßBÄLL CLÜB CÏNCÏNNÄTÏ HAS RAISED ITS LEAGUE^^TM AND WILL ATTEMPT THE SAME FEAT IN EVEN LESS TIME (HOW DO YOU SPELL WOODEN SPOON EN DEUTSCH?).

THE SAME GUY WHO OWNS ARSENAL IS GOING TO PUT A TEAM IN THE US! OMG THATS AMAZING EVEN THOUGH ARSENAL SUCKS ASS!

IN FACT, US SOCCER ACTUALLY MEANT TO PUT THE HALL OF FAME IN TOYOTA FIELD, HOME OF SAFC, BUT ARE SO INEPT THE INTERN SENDING THE EMAIL PUT TOYOTA STADIUM, HOME OF FC DALLAS. ONCE THE DON NOTICED, HE JUST LEFT BECAUSE NOBODY SHOWS UP TO DALLAS GAMES ANYWAY SO THEY HAVE EXTRA SPACE, PLUS MOVING THE CREW TO AUSTIN MAKES IT AWKWARD TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SAN ANTONIO FO, SINCE HE PROMISED THEM A SPOT IN MLS IN HIS PLOY TO KILL THE NASL. ANYWAY, AT THE END OF THE DAY, DALLAS STILL SUCKS. 

**THE LA TEAM THAT DOESN’T HAVE ZLATAN VS THE TEAM WITH THE SWEET-ASS FOX SCARVES** 

BANC OF CALIFORNIA STADIUM IS PRETTY SWEET, SURE, BUT CAN YOU PLAY BASEBALL IN IT?! DIDN’T THINK SO. POINT, USL. PLUS IT PROBABLY HAS WEIRD ZONING RULES WITH IT LIKE THE OTHER SHITTY LOS ANGELES TEAM AND ONLY A FEW THOUSAND FANS WILL HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING THE NEWEST MLS TEAM GETTING EMBARRASSED BY (ONE OF) THE NEWEST USL TEAMS. THIS WILL ALSO BE THE FIRST TIME MILTON BLANCO OF FRESNO WILL FACE HIS FORMER MLS TEAM AFTER PLAYING IN THEIR 2005 DEBUT SEASON.

I would say my style leans more into the classic/feminine aesthetic — I’m 5’2 and not willowy thin, so I find that my body tends to suit more figure-hugging shapes. I work at a fashion museum with two other women also in their early-to-mid twenties. They both have what I’d call the current ‘cool girl’ aesthetic down: think black goucho pants or pleated skirt, white crew neck, white Adidas sneakers, eclectic combo of minimalist chokers/piercings/rings, black Matt &amp; Nat backpack etc. Compared to them I often feel fairly out of date and (dare I say) even frumpy! I like lots of these pieces individually but find that when I combine it all in one outfit I just can’t pull it off and I don’t love the look. I see baggy top on baggy bottoms being worn a lot, but if I wear a baggy item of clothing I feel the need to compensate with a fitted piece elsewhere. It also doesn’t help that I have a pixie cut so anything too androgynous or loose makes me feel very un-feminine and self conscious.

8nrgve,DUTCH_DUDES,"Although it’s healthy to remain sceptical, I do feel we should commend DICE for (so far) not copying gaming trends and instead developing gameplay ideas that challenge players and stand on there own",BattlefieldV,14437,272,272,0,30,0,"I think it’s healthy to remain sceptical until gameplay is released, or even until launch. I also understand the whole “*customization like you’ve never seen it before*” is also a trend but I feel like it’s a necessary trend in order for DLC to be funded. 

However what I want to discuss is from [Jackfrags video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xegBXGaFrOU) that told us about gameplay changes. It seems DICE is finally going into the direction of challenging players with a new Battlefield. 

* No regenerating health (up to a certain point)

* Limited ammo when spawning in 

* Animations for both health and ammo pick ups 

* Fortifying environments so there always changing making it harder to memorize map layouts

* Being able to tow emplacements so players and vehicles have a harder time memorizing where emplacements are

* Revives having animations as well as being able to drag bodies meaning more thought has to be put into reviving then just a button press

* Squad leader rewards for working well as a team, with potential rockets or supply crates, meaning more team play rewards 

* No more visual recoil with each gun having a predictable recoil pattern 

* Probably more stuff I’m forgetting about 



All these hints are not only cool in a immersion they also are actually challenging ideas that I will have to spend more than a game or 4 to get used to. Although I love these games the transition from BF3 to BF4 wasn’t that substantial and it took me a couple games and 1 YouTube video to figure out how to play best. Same thing with BF4 to BF1 except maybe a little longer because of the time period difference. I feel like I’m going to start off Battlefield V as a bad player and actually learn for a couple of weeks or even months on how to be a good player, and that’s a great thing. I’m excited to be challenged by Battlefield game and actually learn in depth meta that could take weeks or even months to fully grasp. 

What’s even better is that in another [Jackfrags video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mSppHRDUHOU&amp;t=610s) about “*Tides of War*”, there DLC model, DICE apparently wants each new front or maps to introduce new meta you have to learn. With him using an example that the maps dropping in November will be about Dunkirk and defending against Blitzkrieg. And although the main base of gameplay changes will be the core meta to learn, this will still be fun and challenging to get used to.

Just thought that’s pretty exciting although I do want to hear what you guys think too :)

But we've never once said it was likely to end, ***much less*** ""***definitely ending***.""

We're trying to figure that out as we finish up Episode 60 and get some original projects rolling. Once we're at a comfortable place, we'll know for certain whether or not we can continue. Buu is over 80 episodes; it requires a lot of work and commitment on our part. This isn't a decision that we want to rush or jump into... and then regret three years from now because we didn't plan our future well enough.

Please be patient with us and remember that this project has meant the world to us. But moving forward as a company full of creatives, it cannot be our full time job, or even our main priority anymore. Life has changed, the dynamics within the industries we work within and alongside have changed, and our company has grown.

8nsol4,SufficientStorm,[Book Excerpt | Betrayer] Kharn talking to a mortally wounded legionnaire,40kLore,31799,121,121,0,54,0,"
&gt;""Captain,"" the wounded warrior voxed. ""I can’t move.""

&gt;Gharte had no legs below his mid-thighs – Khârn couldn’t begin to guess where they were in this
sea of mangled corpses – and his chest was a ruin of violated breastbone and ceramite.

&gt;""Bide,"" he said, lowering the warrior’s helm. ""Kargos will come.""

&gt;The warrior gripped Khârn’s collar with weak fingers. ""The Nails are aflame, even now."" He coughed something wet into his helm. 
""How can that be? I’m dying, and they still sing? What do they want from me?""

&gt;""Bide,"" Khârn said again, though he knew it was useless.

&gt;""Just give me the Peace."" The warrior sank back to the ground.
&gt;""Seventy years of serving the Butcher and his Nails is long enough.""

&gt;Khârn wished he’d not heard those words. Discomfort danced its tingling way down his backbone.

&gt;""You served well, Gharte.""  Khârn disengaged the seals at the warrior’s throat, lifting the helm
clear. There wasn’t much left of the sergeant’s face. Something must have reflected in Khârn’s
expression, for Gharte made his devastated face into something like a grin.

&gt;""That bad, eh?"" he asked. His gurgling laughter became another cough.

&gt;Khârn’s reply was solemn obedience. He held the gladius above Gharte’s left eye, its point a
finger’s breadth above the dilated pupil.

&gt;Any last words?’

&gt;""Aye. Piss on Angron’s grave when he finally lies dead.""

&gt;Khârn wished he’d not heard those words, either.

&gt;He rammed the blade down, with the sound of dry twigs breaking beneath a boot, and the faintest
clink of the point striking the stone under Gharte’s head.

So I have a friend we will name her Mary. Mary was with a guy who will refer to as Douche Nozzle (DN). Mary and DN were happily living together when DN cheats. Mary decides to give DN another chance. 6 months later DN does what cheaters do and cheats. So wisely Mary leaves and gets another apartment. 

Now, when Mary DN lived together both their names were on the lease to their mutual apartment. But DN qualified for the apt on their own so Mary asks that the two of them do the paperwork to get her off the lease. DN asks if Mary will wait until he has a new roommate since this will make it easier on him. Mary agrees

Three months later Mary says something to the effect of ""hey I want my name off the lease its been three months I am not waiting any more."" DN basically tells Mary to go kick rocks. When Mary tells me this I ask a few questions
1) do you still have a key
2) are you on the lease as a resident or a cosigner
The answers are
1) no
2) yes, a resident

So being the nice friend that I am I tell her she should go to the office and get another key. Then we should host a party at the old apartment. There is nothing DN can do since Mary is technically on the lease. Mary warns DN that she will take action if he does not get her off the lease.

DN decided to ignore her.  Imagine DN's face when we show up with about 15 of our friends and a ton of alcohol to party. Needless to say DN threatens to call the cops but I mention that since technically Mary is on the lease as a resident that she is well within her rights to have people over. DN calls the cops. The cops come and Mary explains that she is a resident and listed as such on the lease agreement. Cops ask DN about this he reluctantly confirms that it is true. Now we are not monsters we didn't get super rambunctious or destructive we just stayed up until about 1 am playing cards against humanity then we all went home while DN sat sulking in his room.

The very next day Mary gets a call from the apartment asking her to come sign the lease release form. Mission Accomplished.

8nrrkq,FlyByTieDye,"So, you're new to reading comics, and you want to know which is the best Batman comic to start with?",batman,197180,176,176,0,12,0,"Over here on /r/batman, we want as many people to enjoy Batman in any form they want to, be it comics, movies, games, animated or whatever you enjoy. Because of that, we [do have a recommended reading section on our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations), with sections for new readers, essential stories or sagas, or for particular characters, though if you just wanted a more compact list of what is the best first choices to make, here is a place for that. When making your first choice, or in reading comics in general, it really depends on what about Batman you want to read. I'm going to follow with long descriptions of many of the great Batman starting points, but if there is a particular story you have heard and are interested in, or a type or genre of story that already interests you, maybe you can ask around on the subreddit or message me, and someone should be able to help you find something close to what you may like, otherwise, the list I provide is also full of great reads. 

You see, with Batman, although it takes the form of a continuum of comics, it doesn't really need to be read in chronological order, despite what others may try to convince you of. As a new reader, it is easy to read Batman in trade paper back format, that is, all chapters of a given story collected in the one book. In this form, any chronology or history needed to be known of Batman is given in that story, and you can read these stories as one off events or standalone stories, so long as you have a general idea of what Batman characters there are and what they represent, though even new characters can make a great surprise. There are multiple jumping on points, so I will describe a few, and if one takes your interest, pick it up and start reading, because that is the best way to get into Batman, to just pick something up and start reading, getting to know what type of stories you like, what writers or artists, plots or characters, etc.

Now, most of the really old stuff no one will really recommend, this makes up what is often known as the Gold, Silver and Bronze ages. In the late 80's, there was an event called Crisis on Infinite Earths, which I'm not recommending, though you may see fans refer to the stretch of comics written between the late 80's and 2011 as the ""Post-Crisis Era"". This Era has many beloved stories that many fans will recommend, and is easy enough to jump into.

Before that though, a fan favourite comic called **The Dark Knight Returns** (by Frank Miller) was written that is loved by many fans and even writers themselves, inspiring most of what even the modern Batman represents. It is a standalone story of an old Batman in a dystopic future/80's Gotham, though having a very good understanding of what Batman represents is kind of needed to understand why the comic works so well. I wouldn't necessarily read it first of these suggestions, but it is written before anything else I will recommend, and it is good to keep in mind for later reading as it is such a classic. (It has also heavily inspired many films, such as Nolan's films, BvS and even some of the Arkham games, if this interests you)

Next is the jumping on point for the start of the Post Crisis Era. Frank Miller also got to write the post-crisis origin of Batman in **Batman: Year One**, which is also a really great character story for Batman, Gordon and a solid hero's origin story, of a very early career Batman and Gordon taking on low level crime, which is written excellently. You don't need to start reading Batman comics from issue one and continue reading chronologically to enjoy Batman, though if this type of story interests you, you may want to pick it up. (This serves as the primary influence for Batman Begins, if this interests you).

My next recommendation is also a great starting point, that of **Batman: The Long Halloween** (by Jeph Loeb), though also works as a solid continuation of Year One (though don't feel too constrained by chronology, each work as great stand alone stories). TLH is heralded by many Batman fans as one of the great Batman mystery stories, still featuring an early career Batman to start as a good jumping in point, though starting to have Batman approach more Super crime in his stories. As great as TLH is on its own though, it also has a sequel that is even better (though depends heavily on having read TLH first) called **Batman: Dark Victory**, for future reference if this story interests you. (These also serve as big influences on The Dark Knight, if this interests you).

Also present are starting points for other members of the Batfamily. **Batgirl/Robin: Year One** (a trade paper back collecting both of these individual stories, by Chuck Dicon and Scott Beatty) makes for a great entry point for readers looking to explore the dynamics of the Batfamily, beginning with cornerstones of the family. Following up from Dark Victory, Robin: Year One covers the first year of Dick Grayson's time as a superhero, examining the complex father-son relationship between Batman and Robin, and acknowledging the dangers of having a child sidekick. Batgirl: Year One tells the story of how Barbara Gordon was motivated to become a crimefighter while breaking down social prejudices, while seeding her relationships with various heroes, including her friendship (and later romance) with Dick. For recommended readings of other Batfamily members, or other DC characters for that matter, check out the excellent [recommended reading lists](https://old.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/recommended) available form /r/DCcomics.

Next up, **Batman: The Killing Joke** (by Alan Moore) is also easy first readings for a new Batman fan, a stand alone story featuring one of Batman's greatest and most influential confrontations with the Joker. This is the comic that lead to Batman comics becoming dark, and has about as much influence as TDKR has had on the comics industry (both came out at roughly the same time), and once again, a broad understanding of what makes Batman Batman, what makes the Joker the Joker, and an understanding of their history of confrontations is suggested before reading, as this story really encapsulates all of that, though also serves as an easy enough stand alone story. (This story is a huge influence on Batman '89, The Dark Knight, the Arkham games, and was adapted in 2016 into an animated movie, that wasn't really as good, so definitely read and don't watch this one.)

After all of this, Batman stories start getting convoluted, continuity heavy, and not all that good, until in the mid 2000's when **Batman: Hush** came out (also by Jeph Loeb, who wrote TLH), a new starting point for readers with a mid career Batman, once again solving a great Batman mystery and with one of comics greatest artists Jim Lee, featuring many of Batman's most well known allies and villains, this is the comic that got people into reading Batman comics again after the 90's. If you're worried about timelines at all though, don't feel too concerned, as it was the first Batman comic I ever read and I was never confused, and is I feel a great recommendation for new readers, encapsulating many great moments of mystery, action and a wide span of well known characters that it has a lot for every fan. After this though, it becomes a little harder to recommend starting on points for what is a late career, post-crisis Batman.

Further down the timeline from this is two well known runs, that of [Morrison's](https://i.imgur.com/5o92qw1.png) and [Dini's](https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/sagas#wiki_batman.2C_by_paul_dini), and although these runs are great stuff, they are better for more experienced readers, as they require a bit more investment in Batman's timeline and history to be able to appreciate, though keep these comics in mind for later reading once you'e got hooked.

In 2011, an event called Flashpoint happened (which I'm not necessarily recommending here), that reset the DC comics universe. Many new fans shy away from things like reboots, but it actually makes reading comics easier, by providing easier jumping on points and cutting away a lot of unnecessary history and continuity. The in-universe mechanics of how a reboot happened are not really that important though, but the next ""Era"" of comics is known as the New 52 universe.

The New 52 Batman series is also a really great set of Batman comics (only 10 volumes in this run, and all of really great quality) that's great for new readers. Start with Scott Snyder's **Batman: The Court of Owls** (volume 1), one of the great modern detective/mystery Batman stories, which can be followed up with **Batman: The City of Owls** (volume 2, and needed to finish off that story), which can then be continued in volume order (volume 3 is **Batman: Death of the Family**, another of the greatest Batman vs Joker encounters (different, and much better than A Death in the Family, because comics and comic naming can be confusing), but really, all of Snyder's New 52 Batman run is great.)

In 2016, a new event called ""Rebirth"" rebooted the universe again, and provided a new jumping on point if you wanted to get caught up to the Batman comics that are currently being written. Once again, volume order is simple enough to follow, starting with Tom King's **I am Gotham**, then **I am Suicide**, **I am Bane**, and so on.

This makes up the easiest starting points for new fans to the ""canon"" Batman stories, though there are also some really great non-canon or ""Elseworld"" stories that I will recommend, as some fans also really enjoy these, and if you don't start with them, you can always keep them in the back of your mind for later.

Many fans seem to enjoy the **Batman: Earth One** stories (by Geoff Johns, of which there are 2 volumes) based off a more realistic Gotham, inspired by Nolan's movies. Volume 2 is much better than volume 1, though depends on having read volume 1.

An Original Graphic Novel called ""**Joker**"" (by Brian Azzarello) tells a great Joker solo story, serving as a response to Ledger's Joker in TDK, though in comic form.

Also, while toeing the line between canon and non-canon, **Batman: A Serious House on Serious Earth** (by Grant Morrison, whose whole work on Batman is great, as mentioned above, with the rest of his works involving a late career post-crisis Batman) is also an extraordinary Batman story, also heavily featuring the Joker, though is often off putting to new fans due to its extremely different take on visuals and panel layout, though is an excellent story, and I would recommend keeping in the back of your mind for later, as it is so excellent.

In a similar boat is **Batman: Ego** (by Darwyn Cooke, and collected in the trade paper back Batman: Ego and other Tails). It's not set in the main canon like the above titles, but is still your standard Batman, with this comic being a dissection of Batman's psyche and exploration of Bruce's perspectives on his mission as a hero.

Also, if you have any further questions, feel free to ask, either me or the subreddit, and I will be happy to answer for you!

Have you ever been addicted to something online that just made you feel like your physical self was slipping away? 

I know it’s a banned discussion topic so I won’t dwell on it, but 13 Reasons Why made me want to do something bad (I’m sure you know what I mean) I wasn’t the same after watching it. 

I felt totally worthless because my Instagram posts were only getting 100-120 likes and everyone around me was at least in the 200s but most in the 300s. I felt so unattractive compared to everyone on insta. I woke up day after day waiting for the feelings of 13 Reasons Why to wear off and it didn’t. 

So I deleted my Instagram. I woke up the next day and for the first time in a long time I felt free. I wasn’t measuring my self worth by internet likes. I finally felt like I was living for myself and not to prove something to people on the internet. I got up early for the first time since watching the show, and I actually did something. I ended up cleaning the whole house. I can’t express the physical relief I feel. I feel lighter somehow. I finally feel happy.

Maybe I’ll log on again someday when I learn not to measure my self value off of Instagram and compare myself to models covered in make up and filters. 

I feel beautiful again. I feel happy. I feel worth it. I matter to myself again. 

If anyone else is considering deleting Instagram, I say do it! I feel like I can see the world again for myself and not behind a screen. No more Instagram. No more snap chat. No more Facebook. I logged off. I’m staying off. 

Has anyone else deleted their social media? How did you feel after? What are your thoughts about Instagram? ",False,False,6.0,1527836548.0,1527436599.8321111,-399948.1678888798

He brought me to my FRESHMAN YEAR homecoming. He let his friends fuck me. He bought me booze and coke and weed. His sick friends would let me into the clubs and bars they worked at. He cheated on me and told me about it while we had sex. He fucked my (also 14-15 yr old) best friend. He took pictures of me naked. He took pictures of us having sex. We broke up when I was 16 and immediately afterwards he met a 14 year old from MySpace and drove across state lines to ""hang out"". And during all this time I was being shamed for it... Me. The child. The victim of a sexual predator.  I am fucked up in countless ways despite having a completely normal outward appearance. And now there is NOTHING I can do about it. 

He was a rich spoiled boy. His mother was a fucking THERAPIST and knew about it and turned a blind eye. 

I am 29 now. I look at 18-21 year olds as ""too young"" for me. I would never dream of looking twice at a boy or girl in highschool.

 This shit was not normal. 

How fucking sick was EVERYONE around me to not protect me? To not say to him... ""bro what the fuck is wrong with you?"" 

What did my parents do? Mostly nothing until they almost got in legal trouble for me skipping school and sent me to a psychiatric hospital (that deemed me mentally stable after 72 hours). There is a 13 year gap between me and the oldest sibling so by the time I was a teen, they had grand kids and were done parenting by the time I really needed it. 

It all just hit me the other day while driving, listening to my true crime podcasts, enjoying my day. I used to think how lucky I was for not having been sexually assaulted at all. Except I was. For 2+ years. And I was the one shamed for it. My family still jokes about my ""affinity for older men"". What. The. Fuck.

&gt;
&gt;Entire lobby is torn to shit
&gt;
&gt;Hotel is still open but only renting second floor
&gt;
&gt;Every person so far as been cool with it
&gt;
&gt;So, I'm sitting here thumb in my ass
&gt;
&gt;Hear the LOBBY DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE
&gt;
&gt;*The same Lobby door covered by a 6ft tall sheet of wood plastered with signs saying use a different entrance*
&gt;
&gt;I peek around
&gt;
&gt;It's an old, grumpy looking guy who proceeds to slam his way back through the lobby doors and go toward the side
&gt;
&gt;We have like 2 check ins today and I know 1. So, I print out the other guests reg card and make keys. 
&gt;
&gt;I hear a side door slam
&gt;
From here on, I'll be FC. He'll be GOF for Grumpy old fuck. His speech will be in italics because 90% of it was screamed.
&gt;
FC: Hello sir, how are you? Checking in?
&gt;
GOF: *HOW COME NO ONE TOLD ME YOU PEOPLE WERE RENOVATING?*
&gt;
FC: I'm terribly sorry sir. (i check when he booked). It appears you booked 6 months ago, before renovations started. 
&gt;
GOF: *SO? THIS WASN'T AN OVERNIGHT THING. THEY STILL SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AND TOLD ME.*
&gt;
Fun fact: renovations started the first week of May. I'm not sure why. It's the start of busy season. But they did. So far they're not going great. I digress.
&gt;
FC: Actually sir, the renovations are the result of storm damage. (Partly true) and the company just decided to fix the other stuff at the same time so the property would only be under construction once instead of repeatedly throughout the year.
&gt;
GOF: *THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER.*
&gt;
FC: Well, unfortunately sir it's past 7 and the manager has left for the day since he's working on the renovations personally as well.
&gt;
GOF: *I DON'T CARE GET HIM ON THE PHONE*
&gt;
This man has done nothing but scream at me. I'm tired. I'm mopey. I am not feeling it. I'm leaving. So... The happy face slips.
&gt;
I call the manager. M: from here.
&gt;
FC: Aye boss.
&gt;
M: wassup? 
&gt;
FC: Yeah, there's a grown adult down here throwing a temper tantrum because no one informed him we were under renovations. I make eye contact with GOF.
&gt;
Please note, this phone has a LOT of audio spill. So. You can easily hear my boss's replies.
&gt;
M: Were we supposed to contact each guest and let them know we started renovations?
&gt;
FC: Apparently that's what this man expected. 
&gt;
M: Fuck it. Cancel it. *Hangs up*
&gt;
FC: Well, since you're so unhappy sir we're just going to cancel the reservation.
&gt;
GOF: *FINE. BUT I'M NOT GETTING CHARGED AND I WANT IT IN WRITING.*
&gt;
FC: I'll do the cancellation in front of you and email you the confirmation. I'm unable to change the emails however but we're not going to charge you.
&gt;
GOF: *THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. +POKES ME WITH A BONY FINGER+ YOU'RE GONNA PERSONALLY WRITE OUT THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE CHARGED. 
&gt;
This was the last straw. I've had it.
&gt;
FC: sure sir. Absolutely.
&gt;
I pulled out a yellow pad and wrote:
""No charge for cancellation, X night stay."" And for my signature, I drew a dick. 
&gt;
GOF: *THAT'S YOUR SIGNATURE?*
&gt;
FC: Yes sir. I'd show you my ID to prove it but you're an unreasonable bastard and I don't want you knowing where I live.
&gt;
GOF: *WHAT'S YOUR NAME I'M CALLING CORPORATE*
&gt;
FC: My name is (GUESTS NAME).
&gt;
GOF: (He just glares for 30 seconds then he turns to leave).
&gt;
FC: Have a nice day sir!
&gt;
GOF: *I WAS UNTIL I GOT HERE*
&gt;
FC: With such a positive attitude as yours, I'm sure you'll cope!

“You have to hold still, Commander.”

Kyle muttered a curse under his breath as the assistant continued to apply makeup. The chair beneath him was unfamiliar and leaned slightly to the right. Miranda would have made sure he had a properly balanced chair. After all, this cell was only supposed to *look* like a cell. 

More importantly, he had been imprisoned for nearly two days. It was almost time for his initial confrontation with King Ender. Octavian had certainly had chances to stop by the set and show him the revised script; of course, the Commander hadn’t yet. 

Kyle knew that he never would. *Because the script is a fake. Because no one else can know of its existence.*

Bringing the script onto the prison set had the potential to ruin everything Octavian had planned. Of course, the producers and their assistants would never ask to read it, but they would certainly speculate that there had been rewrites. That would lead to gossip. 

It was obvious that Octavian couldn’t afford for anyone to see them together. That Octavian had done this dozens of times already. He knew what he was doing.

*He’s going to put the blame on me*, Kyle knew, turning as the assistant began to add a new assortment of bruises to his face. *He’s going to force the writers to go along with his new storyline to avoid catastrophe.*

“Commander?” 

Kyle blinked. Had the woman been talking the entire time?
 
“I need you to lay down on the floor so I can add the marks from your lashings. Remember, you have been tortured this entire time,” she said with a smile. 

“Sorry. Of course,” Kyle replied smoothly, standing up. “I was just going over the lines in my head.” He waited for another assistant to stretch out a thick blanket across the grimy stone floor before laying flat on his chest. Another man placed a plate of smoked meat and vegetables within reach. A third added a copy of the *actual* script for a last minute review. 

As he feasted, Kyle rapidly flipped through the upcoming scenes. It was just as he thought. There were no changes. On the main set, the writers produced a fresh copy every day. There were subtle tweaks and potential rewordings based on the reports of the two Kings the night before. On this copy, there was nothing different. Not a single word. 

*What if…*

“Is this the most recent version?” he asked as the assistant continued to work. He was careful to keep his voice warm and unassuming. It wasn’t impossible that Octavian had placed a spy on set, that there were others committed to his cause. In fact, it was very likely. Everyone loved Octavian after all.

“As of a few days ago,” she replied. “We aren’t given daily updates like on the main set. The producers feel it’s too dangerous.”

Her response didn’t surprise Kyle in the slightest. Octavian knew the inner workings of King Ender’s castle. He had been a soldier there before the actual war had even begun. That’s why the old King trusted him so much. That’s part of the reason why–

Kyle stopped cold. *No. That can’t be it.*

But it made sense. Octavian’s ascent wouldn’t stop at taking King Ender’s place. His reign would be short-lived if the show was truly ending. No. Octavian wanted to become an *actual* king. He wasn’t thinking about simply ending the war – he was thinking about *winning* it. 

Kyle glanced to where he had hidden the knife under a pile a straw that served as his *bed*. His temporary plush cot had been removed in preparation of his meeting with the King. On any other occasion, he would have thought the transformation of his cell to have been remarkable. Now, all he could think of was how to stop the rouge Commander before it was too late. 

There was a knock on one of the iron bars. “Wrap it up. The King is on his way.” 

The assistant instructed Kyle to stand and examined him closely as others hurriedly removed the blanket and decorated the stone floor with drops of fresh blood. 

“How do I look?” Kyle asked, giving her his best smile. Miranda would have made sure to bring him a mirror. It was always easier when he knew where his *injuries* were.

“You look great, Commander,” she laughed. “I can’t wait to see you in action!” 

As the others scurried towards the exit, Kyle took several deep breaths to get himself into character. Then, he sat in the bloody straw and put his head between his knees. It was likely that he wouldn’t get a true chance to stop Octavian until later that night, but the feeling of the knife’s hilt against his thigh was reassuring nevertheless. 

A few moments later, the heavy door to the dungeon was thrown open. Wearily, Kyle raised his eyes, careful to keep the left only half-open. 

He had performed for King George a hundred times before, but he had never even seen King Ender. The man was a few years younger than George, his long black hair flaked with gray. The King wore a thick beard that stretched down past the lavish collar of his regal red robes. 

Kyle nearly broke character as he saw Octavian standing behind the king. The soldier had put on his best uniform bearing Ender’s sigil; his handsome face was freshly shaven and his thick blond hair was tied behind his neck. He subtly winked at Kyle as their eyes met. 

With actual disdain, Kyle glared at the other Commander. Octavian wasn’t supposed to be in this scene. *I shouldn’t be surprised at this point. He’s here to make sure I play my part.* 

“So,” King Ender began in his ancient voice. “We meet at last Commander Kyle.”

Kyle spat at the King’s feet in defiance. “I have nothing to say to you.” 

The old King grinned, obviously pleased. “They told me you were a tough solider. I went to sleep the past two nights comforted by the sound of your screams.” 

As planned, Kyle tried to stand up but purposefully stumbled and fell back to the ground. 

“Are you sure I can’t convince you to speak to old George on my behalf?” Ender asked after he was done laughing. “With your help, I can finally win this war. This land can finally be at peace.” 

“I’ll never betray my King!” Kyle growled. 

The King placed a wrinkled hand on the Octavian’s broad shoulder. “Then, the only use I have for you is as a symbol. Your public execution will force George to retaliate. He will act recklessly to avenge his Commander, and I will finally be able to destroy him.”

“When shall I schedule the execution, my Liege?” Octavian asked.

King Ender smirked. “Sunrise. I want you to handle it personally.”

Ever the professional Octavian nodded. “Your will be done, my Liege.” The Commander motioned the King back towards the door with a deep bow. 

“Remember to stick to the script tonight,” he mouthed to Kyle. “Keep up the good work.”

8nspk5,Dennis_Maloney,"I was a disillusioned, sexless young man plotting mass murder, until an experience with MDMA (ecstasy) shattered my bleak worldview. Ask me anything.",casualiama,142266,104,104,0,92,0,"Let me elaborate on the title a little bit:

As I went into my second year of college, I was growing increasingly unhappy with the lack of romance in my life. I read *My Twisted World*,  the autobiography of Elliot Rodger, a kind of incel hero who went on a  killing spree in 2014. The years of loneliness he described and his  righteous anger as he planned his retribution both resonated with me.

As  my failure with women continued, I resolved to follow Elliot’s violent  example if I remained lonely by the end of my college years. I was angry   at the universe. I believed that natural selection had created men and  women in such a way that we could never truly be happy together. I  wanted to show everyone who deluded themselves into thinking that life   could be fair, or that happiness could ever be more than an incomplete,  fleeting experience, that there would always be someone like me who  slipped through the cracks of our society and destroyed any illusion of  order with senseless violence. And on a more basic level, I wanted to  make people care about me, even knowing that that caring would really be  hatred.

But these plans were two years  away, and I intended to  give the universe a fair trial until the time  came. I thought that, in college, my discomfort with dancing and the  party environment was an obstacle to being attractive to any girls. I  happened to read someone's account of the drug MDMA, ""ecstasy"", and its  legendary ability to “teach  you how to dance.” After some deliberation,  I bought some and took it at a party.

I got real high, and then I never came back down.

That   evening turned out to be the end of a nightmare which had lasted far  too long. As I talked to friends and strangers and felt my mind working  in ways it never had before, the uncaring universe I’d believed in was  disproved, replaced by a world of a different kind. I belonged here, and  I wanted to be here, and I was happy to share it with everyone.

The  powerful effects of the drug had tapered off by morning, but I was  changed. The hateful ruts in my mind were smoothed over for good during  those few hours of ecstasy.

That was more  than a year ago, and I've been gratefully exploring our bright world  ever since. But I see a nation that seems confused, about the prevalence  of mass killing, about what to make of lonely, sometimes bitter men,  about what our war on drugs is accomplishing, and more. I don't have the  answers to all these questions, but I hope my own experience can be  valuable as we wrestle with them as a society.

So I'm writing a book telling my story, which I'm calling *Anthem for a Dream*. I want to create an anti\-*My Twisted World*,  a story of loneliness, but one with a happy ending. You can follow my  progress on Kickstarter, if you want. \(I think linking to it directly is  forbidden by [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA) rules, but you can find it.\)

PROOF:  Proof is a little tricky since I’m mostly describing past mind states,  but here’s a screenshot of some entries from my journal, showing what I  was thinking. I included some file explorer windows which show that the  files haven’t been modified recently. \(The 2016\-10\-19 one is off, I  think because I started encrypting my entries on January 2.\)

Every time I have had my shirt off, like when we’re changing before we go out, she makes a comment like “omg you’re boobs are so small !!”. She doesn’t say it in a fully negative way, but it does come off a bit condescending. She’s sort of the type of person that comments on fucking everything, and I like my body, so I never really took much offence to it. I figured she was just stating a fact because she has D cups. 

But the other day she said it in front of all our friends, including guys, when we were all swimming. To be clear, I have B cups, I’m super fit, and she is not. Not to say she’s got a bad body - I typically don’t even comment on or pay attention to other girl’s bodies... but I’m just saying, she’s in no position to be saying negative things about mine. 

Anyway, posting here because when she said that, I had nothing to say back, and I wish I had said something. What would you have done? What should I say next time?

8nscqa,Gorbado,An entire village in south Egypt has been cannibalized,nosleep,12296407,169,169,0,8,0,"Just last week, an entire village in one of the southernmost and rural parts of Egypt had been found slaughtered to the last man, child and woman. 

Autopsy reports suggest that they had been eaten by humans \- however the pictures my boss showed me were quite strange.

You see, the teeth marks and shaping of the bites were similar to humans, however I couldn’t help but notice these were practically stomach sized bite marks. Chunks of flesh and bone ripped right off of lifeless bodies in the pictures I was shown, chunks big enough to kill someone relatively quickly.

The most disturbing of the picture I saw was of the lower half of a body, the legs were still, frozen by death. This body was a young child, he must’ve been between the ages of 9\-12 by the looks of it. 

“*What* did this?” I said, thinking about it but not really intending to say it.

Chairman Richards gave me that too familiar look, his blind eye unmoving but his still functional one closing ever so slightly, suggesting I’m going to not be pleased with what he had to hear.

“I suppose you’ll have to find out.” I knew what he was gonna say before he told me. 

I already knew how this went, and I wanted to try and slide my way out of the shitshow that was surely going to unfold. My mind had some sort of ‘malfunction’ you could say the least, and in that moment all I was able to throw at him was “I thought I was the artifact guy, not the animal guy.” which judging by his look did not save me.

I felt my hands gripping the ends of the chair I sat in, Chairman Richards preferred to keep his office old and expensive looking. The whole place was victorian looking, like something out of Sherlock Holmes. The velvet ends of the chair had a small layer of sweat which I hadn’t noticed, I was nervous.

I had not often been assigned to expeditions relating to monsters or animals, most of these were usually dangerous beyond belief and I tried my best to avoid them. However in the artifact department of things, while things were usually more interesting and were possible to deal with, it was dangerous all the same. 

That’s my job, though.

The air smelled like a combination of freshness and dryness as I hopped off the train, after landing in Cairo I had to take a train straight down to just beyond the border of Sudan.

The only thing on my mind was the fact that I didn’t like the desert much, it was always hot during the day and filled with various animals and insects that were unpleasant as ones imagination would lead them. 

I was instructed to meet a man by the name of Shafar by a hotel adjacent from the train station, but this place looked rural. When I say rural I mean extremely rural, I felt like I was in the early 1900s based on the technology this people had at hand. 

Shafar was to drive me back into Egypt and bring me to his village, he was the only man there that had a car as he was the elder. 

The village in question however, that one isn’t far from the village I was to be driven to. There is a chain of 3 villages there as rural and dated technology wise as the one I saw here, if not more.

I stood outside of the hotel for only a moment before a man with a thick grey mustache and a bald head approached me, he was of an average height and wore tattered clothes that looked like something out of a medieval fair. I found myself in awe at the condition the people lived in at this place. It must’ve shown on my face because Shafar spoke up in a thick accent.

“For most, it is a choice, to leave or to stay in this place. Many of us stay because it’s all they know and people find the things they know to be more comfortable, and that which we don’t know is what we are afraid of.” He was right, it was human nature after all.

“Why stay after the mishap at the village past the one that is next to yours?” I had to ask, even if I was devout to my culture I surely would’ve gotten the hell out of there after seeing something like that.

“Because it is not the first time it has happened.” He parked his car at the side of the road and reached to the glove box in his car, with the heat now searing through the windows and the faint sound of the air conditioner running, he popped it open.

He continued after a pause “Have you heard of The Blemmyes people?” it sounded familiar, but I was unsure so I took a vague guess.

“A tribe from around here I imagine?” It was the best I could give him, small details such as that I couldn’t find myself to be knowledgeable in. 

He exhaled then went on to speak, I wanted to press on with the journey but I could tell this was gonna be a long one.

“The Blemmyes were a people that lived in this region at a point in time, they warred various surrounding nations back in the ‘ancient’ times you could say. They are fabled because not only do we almost never see them, but there was a feature about their kind that one can not easily forget. You see, as shakespeare once said about them in… what was it? Othello! Yes, well he said this  ‘And of the Cannibals that each other eat, The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads

Do grow beneath their shoulders.’ and before you ask, what I mean to say is that these people, for whatever reason have no heads.”

I stared at him for a minute, unsure of what to tell him in regard to his ridiculous story.

I made a motion with my hand for him to continue.

“The Blemmyes faces are on their stomach, they are different than us, not just physically but mentally too. It wasn’t always like that, they used to be civilized but since they started to be killed off in the masses they branched off and become more violent and feral.”

Then it hit me like a pile of rocks.

I pulled a photo out of my satchel I had brought with me, the one of the victims.

“You better be right, Shafar, because judging by what you’ve told me and what these victims look like in the picture it’s the only lead I’ve got in this.” With every fiber of my being I hoped this not to be true, I really sat and thought while we were driving that of all things to have to hunt and or kill, cannibalistic headless tribesmen would be the last thing I’d take my chances with.

We followed a long sandy road deep into the night, and I felt myself nodding off as I stared at the beautiful sky above.

I awoke to the light of dawn, and then of course Shafar’s heavy breathing as I saw him hunched over the wheel of the vehicle, staring ahead with great determination and I saw for a moment in his face… fear? 

I didn’t have the slightest clue as to what was going on, but my heart told me nothing good. I thought back to my boss and felt a sense of dread. Why did I have to get this assignment again?

I decided to get the hell up as his eyes started to widen.

I slumped myself up in my seat, so I can see past the window ahead.

There it was. The village.

First I noticed the mass of bloodied bodies, half consumed and piled into the center of the village as we approached.

Then, there they were.

8nro9t,voidandout,I miss my ex extra hard today. We broke up and he went back to his former wife.,self,267822,133,133,0,26,0,"We were together for three and half years. He was divorced with two kids; I was single and I embraced everything about him - excess baggage and all. I never knew what “feeling butterflies” meant before I met him, never knew what falling head over heels meant before he came into my life.

Admittedly, he had a lot of issues - he was still in contact with his ex wife and although, this bothered me, his assurance that they are done for good was all I needed to swallow the pain and jealousy whenever they would all go out as a family with their kids.

A year and half into the relationship, I got pregnant. I was ecstatic but his reaction to the news was somewhat lukewarm. He told me he’s not sure he’s ready for another kid since his first two are both just under eight years old, but that he loves me and maybe we can work it out. I overlooked this statement and forged on with the pregnancy. Unfortunately, I lost the pregnancy. I was pretty shock when he didnt offer to pay for the d&amp;c and not even any of the medications I had for it. His reason was all his money are already slated to be used for his kids’ tuition and whatnot. Listen, even though this was so hurftful, I chose to ignore it because I love him too much and was afraid that he’d leave me if I insist on things.

While I was recuperating (physically and emotionally) from the miscarriage, I didnt know that he was already secretly reconnecting with his wife. He had a promotion and his salary tripled and apparently, this was enough for them to patch things up. When I confronted him, he said that I shouldnt feel threatened and that they are merely talking “as friends.” This went on for a year or so - with me blindly accepting his seemingly diminishing love and attention. My ego was hurt but I’d rather accept scraps than let him go.

Finally, in Feb of this year, I mustered the guts to break things off. Part of me was wishing he’d realize all his mistakes and stop me from breaking up with him. Well, he agreed with the break up and from that point on, he never initiated contact with me. I, on the other hand, couldnt stop myself from texting him. Since Feb, I have asked him twice to get back with me - thinking that maybe we can work it out. 

Twice he turned me down, saying that though he still has feelings for me, he wants to put this children first. The last time we spoke with each other was last month. I’ve been doing okay - I am determined to not contact him because I wanna retain what’s left of my dignity.

However, today was extra hard. I’ve been feeling so low since this morning and I’ve been bawling my eyes out because all these memories of him are running through my mind. I wanna talk to him but I know doing so would only hurt me more. What should I do? How do i move on? How do i forget? Please someone help me.

8nro9t,voidandout,I miss my ex extra hard today. We broke up and he went back to his former wife.,self,267822,133,133,0,26,0,"We were together for three and half years. He was divorced with two kids; I was single and I embraced everything about him - excess baggage and all. I never knew what “feeling butterflies” meant before I met him, never knew what falling head over heels meant before he came into my life.

Admittedly, he had a lot of issues - he was still in contact with his ex wife and although, this bothered me, his assurance that they are done for good was all I needed to swallow the pain and jealousy whenever they would all go out as a family with their kids.

A year and half into the relationship, I got pregnant. I was ecstatic but his reaction to the news was somewhat lukewarm. He told me he’s not sure he’s ready for another kid since his first two are both just under eight years old, but that he loves me and maybe we can work it out. I overlooked this statement and forged on with the pregnancy. Unfortunately, I lost the pregnancy. I was pretty shock when he didnt offer to pay for the d&amp;c and not even any of the medications I had for it. His reason was all his money are already slated to be used for his kids’ tuition and whatnot. Listen, even though this was so hurftful, I chose to ignore it because I love him too much and was afraid that he’d leave me if I insist on things.

While I was recuperating (physically and emotionally) from the miscarriage, I didnt know that he was already secretly reconnecting with his wife. He had a promotion and his salary tripled and apparently, this was enough for them to patch things up. When I confronted him, he said that I shouldnt feel threatened and that they are merely talking “as friends.” This went on for a year or so - with me blindly accepting his seemingly diminishing love and attention. My ego was hurt but I’d rather accept scraps than let him go.

Finally, in Feb of this year, I mustered the guts to break things off. Part of me was wishing he’d realize all his mistakes and stop me from breaking up with him. Well, he agreed with the break up and from that point on, he never initiated contact with me. I, on the other hand, couldnt stop myself from texting him. Since Feb, I have asked him twice to get back with me - thinking that maybe we can work it out. 

Twice he turned me down, saying that though he still has feelings for me, he wants to put this children first. The last time we spoke with each other was last month. I’ve been doing okay - I am determined to not contact him because I wanna retain what’s left of my dignity.

However, today was extra hard. I’ve been feeling so low since this morning and I’ve been bawling my eyes out because all these memories of him are running through my mind. I wanna talk to him but I know doing so would only hurt me more. What should I do? How do i move on? How do i forget? Please someone help me.

8nt52f,Shaunyowns,Solak - Bug Abuse,runescape,122603,203,203,0,147,0,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to post this personally on behalf of the Player Support, Bug Abuse, Community Management &amp; Content teams.

***

We wanted to update everyone in relation to the recent situation where a number of players abused a bug to gain a significant advantage when fighting Solak. As a result of bug abuse, some of these players were able to defeat Solak and in turn received significant rewards which we feel were gained unfairly.

When a new Boss is released, part of the challenge and excitement is playing through various scenarios to discover the most efficient tactics and approaches to use. For this reason, we have carefully considered whether a player who appears to have abused the bug would have happened upon it by chance (and believed it to be a legitimate tactic), or if there was deliberate intent to exploit an obvious bug.

In this situation, we felt that the experience and caliber of players who were exploiting the bug, combined with the extortionate damage that could be dealt, would lead the players involved to fully realise that this mechanic was not intended.

We are also acutely aware that players who now go on to defeat Solak legitimately, risk their achievements being devalued if the bug abuse of the same content remains unchallenged.

For these reasons, we have decided to track and identify any player who clearly abused the bug whilst it was live. We have now assigned a specialist to review the individual game sessions of every account that killed Solak during the period of time that the bug was live. 

We already know that **252** accounts defeated Solak during this period. Early indications are that the majority of those accounts are legitimate players not involved in abuse, but naturally we need to wait for the full reviews to be completed before we can draw any definitive conclusions.

Conducting those in-depth reviews will take some time as we want to make sure we are fair and do not penalise any legitimate players. At the time of writing, we believe that analysis will be complete by next **Wednesday, 6 June**.

One suspicious account that was reported to us multiple times over night including attempts to sell information / leeches relating to the bug and clearly admitting to carrying out the bug abuse has already been permanently banned.

Following the reviews, any accounts that are confirmed as being involved in a bug abuse situation, will receive an appropriate penalty. Where possible we will keep you updated on our progress, and I’d like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the integrity of the vast majority of players who are enjoying Solak as intended and relishing the challenge presented through fair play and finely tuned PvM skills.

8nt8wm,AnYvia,How To Write a Business Proposal,Entrepreneur,414823,65,65,0,4,0,"A business proposal is an offer presented to a client with the intention of providing services that meet that particular client’s needs. The business proposal should not be confused with a business plan. A business plan is usually a document that details a company’s strategy for meeting its financial and operational goals. 

Preparation: Preparation and planning is an essential part of writing a good business proposal. The time you take to prepare for the task will determine the quality of the document itself. In fact, it’s recommended that you always take more time to prepare than you take writing out the proposal itself. 

During the preparation stage, you will have to consider the audience you are writing to. Gather as much information about the client as possible so as to tailor the proposal specifically to them. Establish also the approach you will use in tackling the client's problem. Sometimes clients require that you include in your proposal what method you will use when working on their problem. This is planned for at the preparation stage. 

Writing the proposal: After being satisfied that you have all the information you need you can then proceed to write the proposal. The document itself has a particular structure that you should be careful to observe. These are the contents of a good business proposal:

1. The title: The title of the business proposal should be interesting and captivating. It basically should be a one-sentence summary of what the entire proposal is all about. Always avoid writing some boring titles for the business proposals you send out. In case you are stuck on the title, don’t worry. You can even write it last after you are done with the entire document. You may get just the right idea of a title in the process of writing. Because you are writing for a specific audience, always have in mind how the client would like the title to look like. 

2. The executive summary: This is a brief summary of the entire document for the busy executive. It includes a presentation of all the key points of the proposal in a compelling manner that will make the executive get a good grasp of the entire document at a glance.  It should be clear, and persuasive as well. This is where the relevant information regarding the proposal is introduced. The approach to be used when solving the client’s problem is also introduced here. 

3. Opportunity statement: This is the part of the business proposal that seeks to deal with the client’s problem in a deeper way. With the opportunity statement, you discuss the client’s need in detail and propose your solutions as well. The length and depth you go to in discussing the problem will depend on the nature of the need. There are some clients who require that you help them identify exactly what the need is, then suggest your solutions. At this point, it will be important to demonstrate to the client that you understand completely what their problem entails and have the perfect solution for them.

4. Deliverables and timelines: After you are done with the overview, you will need to specify the deliverables and timelines for the project. This has to do with what the client should expect from you and how long you will take to work on the solution. You should be careful to make everything clear at this juncture so that neither you nor the client will have unreasonable expectations. Always avoid over or under promising.  It’s important to be realistic where timelines are concerned. In case the project takes longer than you anticipated, you should be having enough time to cover for such eventualities. It will be a great idea to identify any possible areas of trouble that you may run into and inform the client so that they are ware. 

5. Proposed budget: The budget is the most crucial part of a business proposal. It’s actually so important that some clients will read the budget first before considering any other aspect of the proposal. Because of this, you always aim at making the budget accurate, easy to understand and realistic. It’s recommended that you set a fixed price provided it’s tenable for the entire project. There’s also the option of an hourly rate of pay but this may present problems for both you and your client. It’s usually possible to set a value on your work by computing the total project expenditure. An important point to note is the need to have the budget broken down into its constituent elements. The client may find it quite hard to understand and accept a budget that comes in a lump sum without knowing the minor details about it.

6. Conclusion: The conclusion comes in to wrap everything in a nice way. Just like the introduction, a good conclusion will contribute to the overall appeal of your proposal to the client.

8ntfs3,ReginaldODonoghue,Joe Rogan's bad history,badhistory,118146,60,60,0,31,0,"So Joe Rogan \(who has an otherwise excellent podcast\) invited fringe geologist Robert Schoch onto his podcast to speak about the fringe conspiracy theory that Archaeologists are covering up the true age of the Sphinx, and that it is 10,000 years old or more.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vka2ZgzZTvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vka2ZgzZTvo)

I am no expert at geology, so I will leave the debunking of this to the experts. I also recognise conspiracy theories are not the aim of the game here at r/badhistory However I did find some time to debunk another fringe topic which Rogan has promoted on his podcast before, for example [here](https://youtu.be/0H5LCLljJho), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-hYHqnyhvI). The idea that the Ancient Sumerians knew the earth was round and orbitted the sun. This idea originates with fringe Ufologist Zecharia Sitchin, as is based on this tablet:

[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Sumerian\+heliocentrism&amp;rlz=1C1AWFC\_enGB773GB773&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3la\-T87LbAhVlL8AKHVYEAf4Q\_AUICigB&amp;biw=1821&amp;bih=882#imgrc=6r7s13QfPexOmM:](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Sumerian+heliocentrism&amp;rlz=1C1AWFC_enGB773GB773&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3la-T87LbAhVlL8AKHVYEAf4Q_AUICigB&amp;biw=1821&amp;bih=882#imgrc=6r7s13QfPexOmM:)

Which does not show the Sumerian symbol for the sun, which is ALWAYS this:  


[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Sumerian\+symbol\+for\+the\+sun&amp;rlz=1C1AWFC\_enGB773GB773&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=Fk\-UjeaihfLgkM&amp;#37;253A&amp;#37;252CSBKgyXOVxRdfWM&amp;#37;252C\_&amp;usg=\_\_\_MBf\-gKUVFUDriM0Ew4RASP3E6w&amp;#37;3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB3ZqM9LLbAhWIIMAKHYRrAS4Q9QEIKzAA#imgrc=F6LbE9tccFtmtM:](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Sumerian+symbol+for+the+sun&amp;rlz=1C1AWFC_enGB773GB773&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=Fk-UjeaihfLgkM%253A%252CSBKgyXOVxRdfWM%252C_&amp;usg=___MBf-gKUVFUDriM0Ew4RASP3E6w%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB3ZqM9LLbAhWIIMAKHYRrAS4Q9QEIKzAA#imgrc=F6LbE9tccFtmtM:)

Furthermore, all Ancient Sumerian depictions of the universe display the earth as a flat disc with the sun moving across the sky. In the Epic of Gilgamesh for example the sun almost catches up with Gilgamesh as it rises \(Gilgamesh was walking through the cave where the sun rose\).

I care about this because Rogan has introduced the idea to rational people, such as Michael Shermer. Even Graham Hancock \(an infamous bad historian\(, should have known better, him being well acquainted with the excellent work of Sitchin debunker Michael Heiser, whose work on the Nephilim he quotes in his recent book.

I wrote a blog post on this subject here:

It's finally the last day - I pushed it back a few weeks on client request to handle a large project point today, which is mostly complete now, and I'm finally calling it done.

For background, I'm (very) late 30s, retiring from Engineering (mostly civil, finishing up doing construction/project management), have worked for the same firm in numerous roles (high-speed trains, roadway design, construction, expert witness, etc) for over 15 years now.  No kids, married a few years ago, bought a condo in a HCOL city in 2006, but had a special offer that ended up more than covering the market crash losses, and could rent it out for more than my carrying costs if we decide on some longer-term travel.

For references, we spend under $40k/year, and mostly it's been engineering type retirement planning - long slow push hard in the right direction.  I've been saving around 50% of income for over a decade, tracking on a homemade spreadsheet for about 14 years. I never quite broke 6 figures in base salary, but with my hobby job and straight-time overtime added in, I probably made it over a couple of years recently.

Heading back out to finish up and then to celebrate out with some coworkers, but wanted to share with the like-minded people here.  A lot of unlucky things could have derailed it, but doing it also made me a lot more resilient to bad luck along the way and has given us a lot of options going forward.

- Don't catch falling knives. This is gambling.

- Stick to 5-8 positions at one time so you don't go insane tracking them. 

- History does repeat itself. So do businesses, and people. Take that how you will.

- Hivemind is very really when it comes to the market. There are trends people create. Use that to your advantage, and once in a blue moon, it makes sense to bet against people.

It has resulted in six shows (Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Defenders and Punisher), five of them which are on going.  It has also done a lot for the reputation of Marvel TV.  Imagine if the only Marvel shows were Agents of SHIELD, Agent Carter and Inhumans.  Without the Netflix deal we probably wouldn't have had Runaways, Cloak and Dagger, Gifted or Legion.  These shows are probably all expensive to produce.

That being said, the Netflix deal was signed by Marvel back when they didn't know that Disney would one day have multiple streaming services competing with Netflix.  Granted, the Netflix series would never have been green lit for the Disney streaming service but the Netflix series would have been a good fit on Hulu.  The problem may have been Netflix was the more popular service and would have been able to provide better bid.  The Netflix shows may be low budget compared to the movies but the budget other formats would have been willing to provide may simply have been nonexistent.  How cheap is Cloak and Dagger going to look?  

It's not as if they could move the Netflix shows to Hulu.

“As long as they keep making those shows, they continue on Netflix,” said Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos. “Our Marvel series that Disney produces for us — we own those shows. They run until we cancel them.”

So while Disney owns the underlying intellectual property for Jessica Jones, Daredevil or Luke Cage, the Netflix shows based on these comic-book characters remain the streaming service’s property. “We get to use them for a very long time,” said Hastings.

Then there's the question as to whether Hulu could afford to pay for more Marvel shows besides Runaways.  I would like to think they could because Netflix doesn't seem to be adding any new Marvel shows any time soon.  ",False,False,6.0,1527861541.0,1527436599.8321111,-424941.1678888798

8nsm4p,Serialnvestor,Remember the days...,IOTAmarkets,27664,68,68,0,24,0,"Remember back in 2009\-2011? Getting that first cmd wallet. Bitcoin forums. 10,000 bitcoins for 2 pizzas. First transactions. Mining bitcoins on a cpu meant to play starcraft 1. Magic the gathering online exchange. Back then, high hopes were 1 btc would someday be worth $10. Someday it would moon, and the dude with 5,000 bitcoins would be able to pay off his suburban home for hodling. Buying a btc mining pc with student loan money. Lying to the folks over $20 that was meant for groceries but spent on btc. Selling said btc due to needing to pay rent.

People in iota right now think that the moon is $10 or $25 or even $40. haha. I have seen this roadshow before, and I know where it ends in 10 years. Iota has the scaling power bitcoin and ethereum never had before, and never will have. Ethereum can shard and casper and metropolis their way hither and thither, but they are just splitting up their kingdom into tiny fiefdoms, and trying to use rule of law to run the kingdom. Iota is a single monolithic, single minded entity. It has never been forked, \(and probably never will be, due to no miners\) It has greater throughput aka scaling and it has better data storage due to supporting trinary.

Picture a city of the future. The air is thick with drones. The skyscrapers press up against each other casting the streets into gloom. The walkways and catwalks are overcrowded because it is faster to walk or take public transportation than to drive to work. Shops on every corner selling devices and items you are unfamiliar with, for currency you heard of in the ancient days of 2018. Take in the smell. That's the smell of a 2,779,530,283,277,761 iota economy. What's an iota? Well, 200 iota will buy you a burger. 1 miota will buy you a decent hoverboard, or an old style gas car.  1giota is a fortune.

In 10 years, the US dollar will have inflated at 2&amp;#37; per year. That is slightly over 20&amp;#37; devaluation from today, counting compounding inflation. The current US boom will have collapsed in a spectacular bust. Industries will have toppled, and power will have become ever more concentrated in the hands of a few. Elon may have done his first mars trip. It might even have been manned. Coastal flooding will have forced the retreat of thousands of people. Homes will be built sturdier or not at all in hurricane country as the storms get fiercer. Worst case scenarios for global warming will be in full swing. Human overpopulation will be worse than ever. Lifespan will be tied more and more to wealth as the aging rich get to afford life extending treatments. Flying taxi cars will be a thing, as will quadcopter style hoverboards. Amazon delivery drones will be everywhere. Charging stations for drones will be everywhere, and AI will have made serious leaps and bounds. The cutting edge google AI bots that do natural language processing will be able to hold complex rational arguments. Many jobs will have been automated and even jobs that people think are immune to automation will be gone. Businesses will cater to machine, cyborg and human customers, and AI will be giving humans a very stiff run for their money. Even jobs requiring a human touch will be in deep competition with the synthetics.

The technology to keep a human brain alive in a jar after death will be a thing. It won't be used often, but we will be able to do it. Automated swarm technology will be a thing. Cybernetic implants will be a thing. Personal AI will be a thing. Ever taller skyscrapers and ever broader megapolis will be a thing. Mind reading hardware with AI to interpret thoughts will be a thing. And where will iota be?

Well, for starters, none of the machines will pay in dollars. Traders will use iota with smart contracts and leverage them to control other assets. The tangle will be multiple terabytes in size, if not petabytes. Tangle smart contracts will replace legal agreements. Maidsafe will have integrated with the tangle, and tangle permanodes will run on maidsafe virtual nodes, if the tangle doesn't straight up push its own virtual nodes.

If you have ever seen the movie ghost in the shell, that is what the future will look like. And iota is the currency that world will run on. So, remember the days when bitcoin was $1, and bitcoin moon was $10. Remember the days when Iota was $1.50 and iota moon was $15. Because in ten years, 1 iota may very well be worth 1 penny.

Stock up, because the coming world isn't a cakewalk, and it's not a world any of us would think of as idyllic, but we will be damned if we don't walk into that world as rich as kings.",False,False,6.0,1527865985.0,1527436599.8321111,-429385.1678888798

The Total Supply is 100 million coins with no further issuance in any case. The Max Supply is currently 70 million coins, with the remaining 30 million left to be mined over the course of many years. Currently, the Circulating Supply is around 25 million.

**Q：I hear Walton is moving to its own blockchain?**

Main net has just been launched. Stay tuned for details about the token swap and transition to the new chain!

**Q：How do I convert my ERC20 WTC tokens to the real thing?**

You can either leave your coins on the exchange, and they will take care of the switch for you, or you can leave them in your MEW wallet, and the team will provide details on how the tokens will be swapped over. Just sit tight! Details are coming.

**Q: How do I move my WTC to MEW \(or the new Walton Wallet\)?**

For MEW:

I. Send your WTC to your wallet address.

II. Add a custom token using the information below:

Address: 0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74

Name: WTC

Decimals: 18

For Walton Wallet:

Do not send ANY coins to this wallet yet. Wait for instructions from the team. Once everything is safe, you will be able to just create a wallet on the Walton Wallet and send your coins to the public address generated.

**Q：What if I want to keep them on my Ledger Nano?**

You can do that, and the team will still snapshot your wallet and copy it along with your coins; however, the the Ledger may not support WTC currently. Don't fret. Your coins are 100&amp;#37; safe. What that means is, if there is no Ledger support, the only way to transfer your coins out of the wallet will be to expose your Ledger's private key. I don't recommend doing this, as it will make the ledger no more secure than a paper wallet \(still very secure, but a waste of money now\).

So basically, your coins are safe. You can still mine to the address. You just won't be able to move them until Ledger support comes. But if you really need access to the coins, you can break out the Ledger's private key on MEW and log into your wallet.

Ledger support will come, we just don't know exactly when. Walton is also making their own Walton hardware wallets. I'll update this with more information as it comes.

**Q：My GMN is on MEW. Will I ever be able to secure GMN in a hardware wallet?**

As you know, moving your GMN will void your Guardian status because it is attached to the wallet containing at least 5000 WTC; however, the team has stated that they are working on a solution for this and have reassured us that our coins will be safe. We will have to wait for more information regarding whether the transferring of a GMN to a new address will be possible in the future.

**Q：What is the utility of WTC? What gives the coin value?**

In the WaltonChain Ecosystem WTC will have multiple functions:

* Issuing sub chains
* Dividend interest
* Credit and mortgage system
* Distributed asset exchange
* Distributed voting and governance system.

**Q: Is Waltonchain a platform?**

Yes. Waltonchain is a smart contract platform that will have ICOs and dApps.

**Q: But I thought Walton just tracked clothing in the supply chain. What else can it do?**

Walton is capable of implementation in smart cities, smart waste management systems, and things of that nature. That's certainly beyond supply chain. Walton isn't so much a ""supply chain"" coin as it is a Big Data coin. The RFIDs are used to gather data, which is very useful in supply chain management. But it can also be used to combine with smart devices and make an Internet of things network.

**Q: Why does this need a blockchain?**

""It is difficult for the Internet of things under the current central structure to accomplish real autonomous cooperation and effective transactions, because the relevant parties of such cooperation and transactions often belong to different stakeholders with complex and uncertain trust relationships. Therefore, the collaboration and transactions of the current Internet of Things devices can only be carried out under the same trust domain. That is to say, the devices to collaborate and trade must be provided or verified by the same Internet of Things service provider, which significantly reduces the true commercial value of the Internet of Things applications."" \(Page 2 of the [Whitepaper](https://www.waltonchain.org/upload/1507947652573.pdf)\)

To expand, counterfeiting is an obvious answer to this question. There needs to be a way to truly authenticate an item. Blockchain is that answer.

Walton's blockchain also removes data silos. Companies won't have to manage any database anymore. Everything is handled by Walton. Walton uses child chains which are separate from the parent chain. Companies can keep proprietary information secret and private on their child chain, and only broadcast necessary information to the parent chain for public viewing. Blockchains make the sharing of info between companies easy and fast, too. And then obviously, blockchains have perfect transparency and are immutable.

Smart contracts are also extremely useful. In the supply chain industry, after perfectly counting and storing inventory, things can be auto\-ordered and paid for simultaneously with wtc, just as an example. Your mind can come up with a whole host of other ideas related to automation.

Furthermore, decentralized, transparent, and immutable data for things like smart waste management systems, which Walton has designed, and air\-pollution monitoring systems in smart cities would benefit greatly from the blockchain, for reasons explained in the first point from the whitepaper.

You could also imagine on the customer end that wanting to know where all their goods come from is important. This is in line with counterfeiting, but also with things more benign. Imagine wanting to return an item to a store, but can't remember which grocery store it was from. Lots of simple improvements like that are all use cases for blockchain.

**Q: What are the 6 child chains rumored to launch around Main Net?**

One is a Smart City contracted by a local Korean govt. monitoring air particles \(no further specifics\). Another is based in the agriculture industry \(no further specifics\), and another is [Freyrchain](http://www.freyrchain.org/index.html), a culture and arts chain. The other three have not been revealed yet.

**Q: I heard Waltonchain has patented technology. What are the patents?**

The Walton team has filed filed for 13 patents, 7 of which have been approved so far. The patents cover many inventions in chip design, but the main one of interest is the Transaction ID\-reading RFID chip with memory storage. This allows the blockchain to be implemented in the Foundational layer through the RFIDs themselves. The chips can generate their own random ID hash within a secure Key Generation Center within the chip, and the hash along with the data are uploaded simultaneously to the blockchain via their RFID reader. This makes WaltonChain fully decentralized and secure.

**Q：What are the advantages of the RFID IC tag chip designed in this project?**

Existing RFID chip industry cannot meet the development of Internet of Things applications, especially applications for the Value Internet of Things:

* There are few options available while the prices are high
* The transmission power and stability need to be improved
* The reception sensitivity is low
* The anti\-interference ability is poor and the transmission power is low
* The existing RFID ICs have many problems such as high power consumption, poor matching with antennae, and difficult system integration, etc.

The project’s IC design has the following significant advantages:

* High security: The chip integrates asymmetric random password pair generation logic, uses a core asymmetric encryption algorithm with independent intellectual property rights, and an optimized design without increasing the cost and power consumption of the chip, enabling higher communication security
* Tamper\-resistant: A dedicated storage space is integrated into the tag chip for the storage of hash value of tag status and key information
* Optimized anti\-collision design: The chip uses a binary tree anti\-collision algorithm with independent intellectual property rights and a time division multiple access design, significantly improving the tag recognition success rate and the number of identifiable labels at the same time
* High sensitivity: The chip uses an optimized noise suppression technology to improve the noise figure at the receiving end and the overall receiver sensitivity, which plays an important role in increasing the recognition success rate
* Good compatibility: The chip can achieve high\-frequency and ultra\-high frequency functions at the same time, so the end customer can read the information through their smart phone and inquire about reliable product information
* Long lasting: The chip adopts a low voltage and low power\-consumption design, allowing the chip to last more than 20 years  

**Q：How much do the chips cost?**

[Waltonchain in a nutshell with COO Monitor Chan](http://chinacryptonews.com/interview-waltonchain-monitor-chan/):

""We develop and produce hardware such as chips ourselves. This really differentiates us from other companies at the moment. Basically, Silitec, our technical support company, was founded in 2015 and is specialized in manufacturing chips. They already have a R&amp;D team of around 20\+ people, so in that way we are not 'increasing' cost. Next important detail is that Waltonchain’s blockchain technology is written into our chips. This means that unlike traditional RFID chips that have their own specific ID and cost around $0.15 to $0.20, the chips we develop will be below 5 cents. With the volume of sales increasing, the overall cost will spread over many units, and the system's cost and ID’s cost will go down consequently, or simply put, economics of scale will do the work.""

**Q：I need help with mining. What resources are out there?**

[r/WaltonchainMining](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltonchainMining) is for this purpose. Community members here have done testing with many different configurations and have provided ample information for anything you need with setting up your cpu/gpu rig.

**Q：How many GMNs are left?**

The Waltonchain [Explorer](http://waltonchain.net/#/lasttxblack) now tracks these addresses.

####/r/AccidentalCosplay 

**739** cosplayers for **2 years!**

I really love the small subs. Especially when I find a small sub that's small for seemingly no reason. I look at the content here, and it has a broad appeal. It should have thousands of users, not hundreds. Maybe we can help to change that. 

Ever see someone in public and thing, ""Wow, that person really is dressed like so-and-so?"" This is the sub for documenting those outfits. It's when people dress in a way that they look like someone without having done it on purpose. Hence, accidental cosplay. 

Let's look at some of the popular posts:

* [A minion](https://i.imgur.com/HGDpzqg.jpg)
* [Snow White](https://i.redd.it/gmxsuoymvtkz.jpg)
* [Seulgi accidentally cosplays Candace](https://imgur.com/a/wqmZj)

8npll0,Thinks_Like_A_Man,"I had an epiphany that CICO isn’t actually a “diet” to lose weight, but relearning to eat in the manner I would be if I was at my ideal size.",loseit,854277,624,624,0,116,0,"I have failed at so many diets. I have done Atkins, Keto, a little this and that, but I never reached my goal weight, nor was I successful in keeping it off. And honestly, I couldn’t stick with it because it was about depriving myself to reach some goal, not about fixing my fucked up way of eating. 

While they did take off some weight, I knew it wasn’t sustainable. I always wanted to lose it fast so the pain would be over quickly.

This time, I spoke with my doctor at length, he was quite helpful. Just admitting it was a huge first step. I had a friend that went from prediabetic to ideal weight by CICO and kept it off five years. It wasn’t sexy or exciting, it wasn’t *dramatic*.

I started really examining my relationship with food. I had to admit I had no idea how little my body needed, what qualified as a reasonable amount, or even what I should be eating. Years of diet confusion had taken their toll. I used to know these things intuitively before I packed on over 100+ lbs. 

I didn’t even realize that I didn’t know. **I think this is the problem for most overweight people.** We are all victims if a society which has normalized eating dysfunction.

I had no idea how many calories I was consuming, or that I was drinking a fair share of alcohol. I confused *being hungry* with the desire to mindlessly eat. Like if I wanted a second slice if pizza, I must *need* a second slice, I was “hungry.”

Years and years ago, I was a runner, 5’8” and weighed 125 lbs. I had never restricted my food intake or denied myself anything.

I really thought about how I ate back then. I would consume about 1500 calories a day, and really chow one or two days a week. 

And it sort of hit me. . . 

**I realized that my 1500 calorie intake per day is not eating so much at a deficit as it is that 1500 is how much I should normally be eating to maintain my ideal weight.** 

To state it another way, I am not eating to lose weight, I am eating to maintain a lower weight. That is not to say I can never go over that, but this is my new reality. My goal is no longer to lose weight, it is really about fixing my messed up eating patterns. The weight is a symptom, not the actual problem. 

I never looked at it this way before.

This time it feels very different. It is not a case if “I can’t have that because it is not on my diet” but reprogramming myself to truly understand what it means to eat healthy.

What I have come realize is this:

**CICO only seems like calorie restriction, deprivation or a “diet” when compared to the wildly unreasonable modern Western way of eating.** ln reality, CICO is really about resetting your calorie needs, your expectations for portion sizes, recalibration of your meal times, and learning to make healthier choices.

This isn’t about calories-in / calories-out, it is about learning to eat for what your body needs after living in an upside down society of completely skewed portions, and incredibly abundant poor food options.",False,False,6.0,1527832699.0,1527436599.8321111,-396099.1678888798

Anyway, I played sports so I couldn’t work until school breaks. What better way to earn some cash for the holidays than a temp package handler?  I wasn’t doing anything better.

During this time in the late 90s, we would leave budget rental trucks at locations that could ship for us. This way, all we had to do is go pick up the truck and take it to our main facility to be offloaded.  It was a cake job and I got paid pretty well. 

One night, we get to a store that sells our shipping services. A man was arguing with a store clerk about the size of his package. My buddy and I ask whats up and the clerk tells us the package dimensional weight is too big (dimensional weight is used to calculate how much space the package will take up on a truck/plane).   Oh, it also may not fit through the conveyor belt system at the main facility.

Anyway we remeasure and confirm its too big. And the packaging was some cardboard boxes cut up and taped around this large rectangle item.   The guy goes bizerk and demands that we take his item or he’ll make sure we are fired. 

Finally, we decide its not worth the argument and agree to take it and take the chance. We ask if it had insurance on on it and the man said,  “this is basically indestructible, so the $100 you give is ok. “ We take the package. 

About 3 days later my boss calls us on the radio and ask us what we know about this item. We tell the story and ask why.  Our boss told us the belt system destroyed the item beyond repair. 

He then tells us that it was a Dodge Viper carbon fiber T-top and was worth about $5000.  He really should have paid for the insurance.  I never heard anything else about it. ",False,False,6.0,1527867846.0,1527436599.8321111,-431246.1678888798

8nsjgj,RedSnapperVeryTasty,Sharing a hurricane season prep tip I don't hear often enough,TropicalWeather,42948,72,72,0,7,0,"First off, Happy Hurricane Season everybody!  

I thought today would be a good time to share what I think is an important tip that I don't think I ever hear anybody talking about, that I learned from experience last year during Irma.

**If you live in a stucco house, like many of us in Florida do, go outside and check for settling cracks on your walls and seal them now.   If a storm is coming you'll be too busy doing everything else to do this at the last minute, so don't wait on it.**

Early on during Irma, we noticed a small wet spot on the floor near our kitchen baseboards.   We thought that maybe something spilled, but then the wet spot got larger and larger until we determined it was seeping out from the baseboards.  We went through all the towels, and our neighbors towels, really quickly trying to hold back the leak.  So we got out the shop vac \(luckily we never lost power or we'd be in trouble\) and just set it up near that point to suck up the water as it came in.   We had to deal with a loud\-ass shop vac all night, but it did keep the water from becoming a big problem.

The next day we found that the water was being driven in through some stucco cracks on the wall that was facing the wind, and that water was then making it's way into our kitchen from there.    The next couple of days we dried everything out, took some mold prevention measures, and then sealed everything up.   So far so good.  No more water coming in even during this past, very wet &amp; stormy week in on the Florida's gulf coast.",False,False,6.0,1527865493.0,1527436599.8321111,-428893.1678888798

I've been a follower of minimalism for a while and everything I could not get rid of due to time or lack of transport or motivation was in that part of the house. Everything important was stored in watertight crates and has no damage.

I may also have to move out for a while so the homeowner can fix everything. Roof, ceiling, walls and floor.

This will be the opportunity to get rid of a lot of stuff and just keep my belongings that add value.

My stomach sticks out a little more, because although there's a thin layer of fat/loose skin (thanks pregnancy x 2), I've actually got abs. Plus my waist trims and I get really nice back muscle (back crack is my fave).

For some reason, I subconsciously WANT a flat 2-dimensional body and my brain uses that as my goal. However, the reality is that when I am getting in shape, I am more three-dimensional (as would make sense).

My body shape is simply more curvy (think kardashians - except I don't need butt implants and have less boobs) and I feel like an 'athletic' body type looks different on me than on other people. Anyone else struggle with this? My clothes are looser, my waist is smaller, and my brain is all 'OMG your belly is rounder! you must be fat!'.

Broki had plagued me for four moons and kept me from my prayers. But, he no longer has power over me and I have returned with a vengeance. Despite losing weight from 178lbs to 160lbs, my lifts shall surpass what they were before.

My rotator cuff and shoulder have had problems with bench for no less than 18 moons. It has made bench my most difficult prayer, and I have always neglected it because of the many problems it caused and weakness I felt.

However, Brodin may have lifted my curse. Yesterday was my second time praying with bench after my absence. I was meticulous about hand placement, setting my shoulder blades and feet, and driving through my core and glutes. I warned up with sets of 5 so as to not aggravate my shoulder. 

When I got to 115x3, I heard a whisper. It said, ""Sister, thine shall press 135 today."" I pondered while I rested between sets. Was this the foul temptation of Broki, leading me to strain my shoulder? Or was it the Allspotter guiding me to glory? I loaded the bar and meticulously placed myself in the proper positioning.

And lo, the weight did drive from mine chest with steady speed for a single rep, and no pain emitted from my shoulder during the lift

There is some minor tightness in my shoulder this morning, but it feels as if it was caused by an accessory movement I performed.

Toast with me, and let us bask in our strength!

8nplfh,TitaniumDragon,Destiny 2 is a game with no heart,patientgamers,195793,330,330,0,105,0,"Destiny 2 is the game made by Organization XIII when Square-Enix took a decade and a half to release Kingdom Hearts 3. Much like the nobodies of the Kingdom Hearts universe, Destiny 2 is a game that is superficially beautiful and perfect – outwardly, everything looks okay. It has great graphics, a solid graphical style, and decent gunplay.

But when you go past the surface, you realize that there’s nothing inside – the game has no heart.

Destiny 2 is basically a Borderlands MMORPG – a looter-shooter, with some PvP arena multiplayer thrown in. It is a MMORPG – you constantly see players around you in the world – which of course makes the game’s single-player campaign, of you being the LONE GUARDIAN who has REGAINED THEIR LIGHT (i.e. their superpowers) into a bit of a farce, what with all those other lone heroes who saved the world running around with you.

But let’s face it – you don’t care about the story.

And that’s a problem, really, because Destiny 2, like all games, needs something for you to care about. But the problem is, Destiny 2 doesn’t provide it.

The world? There’s pretty much no real lore to it – everything feels very arbitrary. You fight some bad guys, but there’s no real coherence to it. You have some allies, but they’re just kind of there. What’s the point of it all? I don’t even know, as I never really got to care about any of them. You don’t spend a whole lot of time around any of them, and they’re mostly about business rather than having any sort of personal character that you’d latch onto. Cayde is the “funny irresponsible one”, and the others are… pretty much just various kinds of military leaders, really. There’s a sniper in one area who is an older guy who wants to be left to snipe in peace, but while he babbles about personal stuff a little (more so than other people), there’s not really enough there to latch onto.

So what are the stakes? There really aren’t any. Destiny 2 has the shape of a world, but it has none of the form or substance, and it is blatantly there just to deliver on its looter shooter nature.

You might think that good core gameplay would make up for this fact. Alas, it really doesn’t. The game does have decent variety for a campaign of its (fairly brief) length – you’ve got a reasonable variety of big beefy guys who move around on jetpacks and who are pretty tough, machine enemies with glowy spots in non-standard locations as their weapon point rather than just the head, more slender, agile enemies who spend a lot of time running around, and the “magical” enemies lead by flying wizards. Each of these factions has multiple enemy types, including a few different types that can be made into bosses, and they work well enough for what they are – but the problem is that it all ultimately feels rather hollow. The optimal strategy against all of them is either “stand behind cover and shoot until you’re injured, then go behind it to heal” or “just keep shooting the melee enemies as they keep rushing at you”. It is only in a few places that the game really does anything to mix this up, having enemies spawn in behind you and forcing you to move, or having enemies rush at you to melee you while there’s a bunch of enemies providing covering fire, and these dynamic moments are where the game is the most fun.

But most of the game is not this, but is instead a bunch of fairly static, stale encounters where you are more or less just gunning down bad guys ahead of you. And while these are actually okay from time to time, the game simply cannot subsist off of these sorts of mechanics for all that long.

The result is that the campaign is about the right length for what it is, but [i]this is a looter shooter[/i], meaning that the real focus of the game is to play it over and over again to try and grind for better gear.

And it is here that the game utterly fails, because the game mechanics simply cannot endure such repeated exposure. The game has already shown the player pretty much everything it has to offer in the main body of the campaign, and by the end of it, the player is maximum level and has a nice set of equipment. All that is left at that point is a bunch of side-quests – which are no different from what came before – and the PvP, which, while decent, isn’t anything particularly remarkable compared to games like Overwatch.

As a result, the game runs out of steam as the player is about to hit the grind phase, and there’s just no reason to stick around – the game doesn’t really have anything left to show the player at that point, just more of the same, so what is the point of even grinding?

But the utter lack of any sort of heart to the single player campaign means that there wasn’t any point to that, either – it was a setup, a prelude to the looter-shooter endgame, but it wasn’t really all that fun or memorable. Stuff happens, but there’s no one to latch onto and no world to really get involved with. Characters like Cayde-6 and Failsafe feel like they’re aping characters like Deadpool and GlaDOS, albeit without the charm and wit that they had, while the other characters are all even more forgettable, with me even confusing the names of two of the main “heroes” on a constant basis. Indeed, even now I struggle to remember the names of even half of the NPCs in the game, and the PC themselves, as a silent protagonist, has no character at all (an odd choice, considering that your companion constantly chatters to people and at you).

The result is that everything just feels like it turns to ash in your mouth. The main campaign is an empty experience, and there’s no reason to care about the end game stuff, either. The game is almost entirely competent mechanically, with only the odd hiccup here and there, but it is all in service to an ultimately hollow experience that never manages to engage the audience and make them care.

Even for the people who just want to grind, Destiny 2 seems to fall down. In the endgame, after reaching the level cap, you eventually reach the point where the only way to get better gear is to complete one of a handful of weekly challenges. After you’ve done those tasks, there’s no way to get better gear until the weekly reset. While this discourages people from just spending their whole life grinding away, it also means that you can’t even do the raid (the centerpiece of end-game content) until you’ve spent about a real-life *month* dong that end-game weekly grind, if not more.

All in all, I can’t really recommend this game to anyone. The Borderlands games do what this game does, but better, and with more style and flair, and while characters in Borderlands may not have the same agility they have in Destiny 2, the game just does more to engage you. And likewise, games like Overwatch pull off the PvP much better than this game can hope to. It isn’t that Destiny is bad, per se, so much as that it never manages to actually be good – only inoffensive at best. But a game needs to actually be good to be worth playing, and Destiny 2 never crosses that threshold.

Me: ""Well let me take a look for you.""

\(I begin to do my think tapping the keyboard like a crazy person. I type fast so I get there quick.\)

WL: ""But, But, when I called you 3 days ago you have 17 rooms available.""

Me: \(after a big eye roll so hard I was afraid they would get stuck in the back of my head\) ""Well that was 3 days ago. We have since sold out. Did you already make a reservation when you called?""

WL: ""Well, no. I was shopping around.""

Me: ""Ah, well unfortunately, since you didn't make a reservation at the time of your first call, there is a chance that the rooms will be sold out.""

WL: ""But I asked them to hold it.""

Me:"" Oh I see, well did you give a credit card in order to hold the room? That is the only way a room will be held is if you provide credit card information. Otherwise no one here would hold the room for you.""

WL: ""I told him that I would call back with it later.""

Me: ""Then the reservation doesn't stand . Again, no one will make a reservation without a valid credit card.""

WL: ""Well...can you?""

Me: ""No. We are sold out for 2 of the nights, I will happily make one for the other nights pending you have your credit card with you.""

WL: ""Oh well I don't have it with me.""

Me:""Then I'm sorry I can't hold a room without it.""

WL: ""My husband is here, can I use his?""

Me: ""Sure. No problem.""

No I begin to get her info and repeat back to her the first reservation out of the two thinking that she understands that 2 of the 6 nights we are sold out and she would need to find a room somewhere else. I get to the end of the reservation and begin to repeat her dates of stay back to her. Mind you this is the first of two which I assumed is what she agreed to after telling her several times that we were sold out for 2 of the nights.

Me: ""So that's the night of the 5th and 6th. The night of the 9th and 10 will be easy.""

WL: ""No! that isn't right, I wanted 6 nights.""

Me: ""Again ma'am. I told you that 2 of the nights in the middle are sold out. All we can do are the first 2 and the last 2. There are no options otherwise.""

WL: ""But when I called 3 days ago you had plenty of rooms.""

Me: ""I need you think about this conversation and then you can call back and book the first 2 and the last 2 only. Thank you. Goodbye.""

I hung up on her and she hasn't called back. ",False,False,6.0,1527824110.0,1527436599.8321111,-387510.1678888798

8nqlye,TheAlacrityOfAyu,I think I saw a children's TV show that hasn't been invented yet,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,241246,164,164,0,107,0,"In can't remember exactly how old I was but we were living in our first house so I was no older than seven. I used to, like many children, get up early on Sunday mornings and watch children's television. Recently, I had a flash of nostalgia and wanted to look up the intros all my favourite shows from the early 90's so I searched for them in YouTube.

I found The Fruities, The Biskitts, A Pup Named Scooby Doo to name just a few but there's one I can't find any trace of. It was called 'The Cockadoos' and it was an American/Canadian cartoon about a cockerel who lived in a hen shed on a farm with his family (The Cockadoos) and would spend every episode trying to be famous. I asked my mum if she remembers this and she said yes but it was a bit naughty for a children's TV show because they used to say, ""clucking heck!"" and ""cluck you!"" My sister even recalls one scene where the mother (who always wore a yellow, frilly apron) put a frying pan on the floor and sat on it. You just saw her cartoon face staining and then there was a crack sound. She put the pan on the cooker which now had a cracked open egg in it and said, ""Kids, breakfast is almost ready.""

I presumed it must have been taken off air as my sister said it only aired about three or four mornings then we couldn't find it anymore when we scrolled through the channels.

However, me and my sister both remembered the catchy theme song and began singing it together. Then we remembered something else really strange. The main character - whose name I can't remember - was, on one particular episode, trying to make himself famous and was doing different wacky things to become a celebrity on the net, which seemed kind of strange as children of the early 90s wouldn't have been able to relate to jokes about the internet. 

However the craziest thing is this: In one scene I remember in detail that the main character recorded himself and some of the other animals catapulting themselves into the air in crash helmets. The cow (who I think was called Bella or Bulla) then uploaded it onto the computer to a site called 'MooTube' which was continually referenced throughout the episode.

I said that at the time we must have been too young to realise this was a play on the word YouTube but while I was saying this, my sister just interrupted me and said, ""YouTube didn't exist back then."" I thought she was denying my memory at first but she said that she remembers it too but that it was impossible. I even recall that every time they checked to see how many ""hits"" they had, a big picture would appear on their computer screen of a red rectangle with a white hoof print inside - obviously a reference to the YouTube red and white play icon. 

She told me that YouTube wasn't invented until the early 2000s. I denied this saying it must have been because they wouldn't have referenced it otherwise, but we investigated further and discovered that YouTube was actually invented in 2005, about ten years after we remembered seeing this show. 

I speculated whether we were older and were mixing it up with a similar show but my sister, who would have been 10 or 11 at the time (I was 6 or 7) was sure it was at our first house which we left when I was 7. To be honest, I only remember watching it in that house too so it had to be 1994 to 1996 ('93 at a push but I don't think I'd have been that young). 

Confused as hell, we began trying to hunt down this show. We searched everywhere and even tried emailing the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 because we couldn't recall which network it was from - we only had the five main channels back then. We haven't heard back from any of them yet, but it was only about a week ago so we'll wait and see. My sister reckons they won't know what we're talking about, but I think surely it must be in their archives. Can a show just disappear without any record? 

Literally there's no trace of this show on the internet. No one knows what we're talking about. No one we know outside our household even vaguely remembers it. My sister said to me last night that given the MooTube reference, maybe it hasn't been invented yet and we were watching something from the future. I laughed at first. We both did. But now I'm wondering. I don't ever remember it being announced by presenters or featured in the 'up next' line up. We just used to flick through until we found it. What if there was a signal to the future to our old, boxy Panasonic. Honestly, I'm freaked out and I have chills now whenever I think about it.

If you know the show I'm talking about it's called The Cockadoo's. The animation was a lot like Two Stupid Dogs  but a bit more ropey and exaggerated. It was a chicken, his mum, dad, sister (a chick), and grandmother and friends on the farm (a pig, cow and possibly some others). 

Please let me know so I can investigate further and maybe put it to bed.

UPDATE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE

Somebody asked us to write down the lyrics. I could only remember the chorus but my sister added bits of the verse in. It's full of gaps because we thought it was better to leave it blank than to guess. It was a jazzy kind of intro and then the words were as follows.

Verse: In a lil ol' farm in the middle of the country (do-do-do, do-do-do) There's a lil feathered [something, something, something] (do-do-do, do-do-do) Dad is hen-pecked and Mom is [something] (do-do-do, do-do-do) And [Something] is always roosting in her bed (do-do-do, do-do-do).

Then there was a bridge with a list of quirky words with the ""est"" rhyme.

Oh magic quest, chicken breast, haunted nest too. [Something, something] knows what to do.

Then a second line that was also a list of rhymes but it was sang faster as the music quickened in a build up to the chorus. Neither of us can remember any key words of the second bridge line.

Chorus: Backaaw! [Something, something] Backaaw! And his farmyard crew. Backaaw! There's always [something], Backaaw! In the Cockadoo house.

Yes there's always [something] with the bock-bock-bock, they're he Cockadoo's. (We think).

Atlas’s gang retreated shouting down the stairs. Florence nearly ran down after them, but Malina grabbed her elbow and said, “*Stop*. We need to take fifteen fucking seconds to plan.”

“I’m going to shoot them in the back. That’s the plan.”

“We’re saving our ammunition for the fifth level,” Malina snapped.

“Yes,” Boots murmured. “Smart lady. Atlas is also.”

Clint rubbed nervously at his scarred temple. “We let them run. Obviously we let them run.”

“I don’t want that fucker to have two good teams for the next round, I’ll be real honest.” Florence kept looking at the stairs, her face twisted with desire and regret. “You know he’ll just join whichever one wins. Double his odds.”

Boots rolled his eyes at her. “You’re just angry is him and not you.”

“Are you and I going to have a fucking problem, Bootsy?” Florence leaned so close into his face that they reminded Clint of snarling dogs, seconds from tearing into each other. 

“Maybe.” His smile was lazy, easy. “But first—” he pointed skyward “—we deal with dragons.”

Clint shook his head. “Dragons are on our side.” Paused. “Most likely.” 

Florence cut a sharpened glare to Malina. “This is a hell of a lot longer than fifteen seconds.”

“I’ll go first.” Malina nodded to Florence. “You follow me up in case one of those bastards is waiting for us in here. Clint, you make sure he doesn’t fall over.”

Boots gave Clint’s middle a fierce and friendly squeeze, like they were already friends. “I make sure he doesn’t get shot.”

Clint blinked fast, wondering if Atlas would really do that. Leave one of his men here to die. Surely not, not with that number looming over them all. Magic number five.

On their way down again, Clint caught himself checking every corner and half-open door. Vomit rose involuntarily up his throat. There was a body in nearly every room, puckering stab wounds. The anguish and terror drawn on their frozen faces was too *human*. He couldn’t bring himself to imagine Malina holding someone down and bringing a knife into them over and over while they screamed and screamed and—

He looked away and tried to tell himself it was only a game.

But when they stood in the entry hall as Malina and Florence declared the house all clear, he couldn’t help but ask, “Why did you have to kill everybody?”

Florence’s stare had force and fury. “So we wouldn’t deal with what’s happening right now.”

“Did you have to fuckin’ stab them to death, I mean, Jesus…”

Boots started laughing. “Not many nice people in this game.”

Malina rolled her eyes. “Yeah, Clint is the *nicest*.”

But Florence surprised him in her intensity. She whipped around and gripped his shirt collar in both hands, her pupils boring into his. “These people are not real,” she said through her teeth. “The people waiting for us at the end of this fucking game are. Stop thinking with your heart, and use your fucking brain.” She shoved him away.

Clint kept himself from staggering backwards, but only just. “I just don’t see stabbing someone forty times as reasonable self-defense.”

Boots clicked his tongue. “Why you have to be mad?” He couldn’t bite back his grin when Florence looked at him, sourly.

For once, Malina was the voice of reason. She snapped at them all, “Guys, argue later,” then threw open the front door and led the way out, gun-first. She whipped her rifle around in a couple steady sweeps before declaring, “They took off.”

Florence twisted the grip of her rifle over and over, her face lined with frustration. “Should have chased them.”

Clint tuned out their bickering. He tried to find Atlas’s tracks in the snow, but it was all churned up from the horses, the stamp of the dead viceroy only a few hours earlier. His whole body ached with exhaustion the more he lingered on the time of it. Prayed that the next level would not demand of him sleep and food. Boots hung even heavier from his arm as he leaned gasping into Clint, shotgun raised in his right hand, as if he planned to push Clint away and start shooting at a split second’s notice.

At first, when Clint looked up, he could not see the dragons. He could still hear their wings summoning up storms, buffeting the wind that tugged at his cloak. But then he plucked out from the stars the shape of wings veering toward them, steadily growing closer. And he couldn’t blame Atlas’s gang for fleeing.

There were three dragons, plummeting out of the sky. Impossible shadows against the dark sky. Boots went board-straight beside him and started murmuring to himself in disbelief. 

The first dragon skittered along the roof of the stable, knocking off shingles like scattered pebbles. Clint recognized the nimble black wings, the long green-eyed stare, frighteningly intelligent. And when the dragon skidded to a stop in the snow, kicking up a tiny avalanche, he could make out Sige up on the beast’s back, frowning down at him.

“What happened?” the dragon rider roared, pointing at the signal fire. 

Malina offered him a shrug. “Erwulf figured us out.”

“Couldn’t kill them fast enough,” Florence added, bitterly.

Far down the end of the road, Clint saw the shape of a person on the horse. The moment they saw the dragon, they jerked their horse around and galloped away. He stared after them, and for half a second he nearly wished they could just shoot him. Even though he was probably only a villager following his storyline, investigating why the viceroy had raised an alarm. Witnesses felt dangerous. That meant more bodies, more weapons, more risk…

Before he could linger any more on that thought, the other dragons landed, shaking the earth like the fists of an angry god. One was a deep amber, color of unearthed gold, and it pawed at the snow delicately, as if it did not care for the snow between its claws. He faintly recognized its thick-bearded rider as one of the men from the cave. He patted the dragon’s neck and murmured things to it in a language that Clint couldn’t understand, even if he had been close enough to hear it.

The other was black as the sky, a near-twin to Sige’s dragon Kali, but it was massive. Its shoulder was four or five feet taller than the smaller dragon’s, and its stare was silvery, perpetually unimpressed. It was large enough to stare into the second floor windows of the viceroy’s home while reclined on its haunches. 

And Daphne sat up on its back like a little bird. Bright-eyed and waving down from behind Leada. For half a second, Clint had to mute the incessant panicked voice that urged him to tell her to get down *right this goddamn second*. At least she wasn’t alone on that thing. He couldn’t bear the image of that dragon deciding to shake her off midair. 

“Daphne!” Clint crowed. He couldn’t help his delight at seeing her hale and whole. “What the hell have you been up to all day?”

She beamed down at him. He had never seen her so happy in her own skin. She always looked faintly vexed, overworked, as if she were eternally discomforted around people. But up there on that great beast’s back, she looked like she had found a way outside the circles spinning in her head. “Riding dragons!” she cried back. “And reading!” She pulled her battered copy of *The Inferno* out of her shirt and waved it at him.

Clint wanted to sink to his knees in relief. Leave it to Daphne to bring a book with her, even on a dragon ride.

Sige vaulted down from his dragon’s back and landed in the snow that was already turning to slush from the heat of the dragons’ bellies.

For the first time, Boots seemed afraid. He tried to hold himself up and grip his shotgun in both hands. His stare flickered between the three beasts, tracing their sharp, reptilian eyes for the first warning of death.

“You came at just the right time,” Malina said.

Sige looked up at the burning beacon doubtfully. “Our timing could have been better.”

Leada unfurled a rope ladder and anchored it to two of the huge spikes jutting from her dragon’s spine. She climbed down to the end of the ladder and leapt the last few feet back to the earth nimbly. “We worship Fortune,” she reminded her brother, “and so she is always in our favor, though she may reveal her hand with time.”

He rolled his eyes and waved her off. “There will be an army,” he said, his voice heavy as falling stones. “They will come now.”

“And we will fight them,” said the third rider, his accent so thick Clint could hardly understand him. He had descended his dragon so quickly Clint had not quite registered it. He’d been too busy watching Daphne descend that ladder, the dragon’s immense head curved back to observe her in fascination. He gestured to Clint’s haphazard team. “And you will help.”

TLDR:
- At the time of the cuts, the steel producing industry had a workforce of about 188,000

- 99% of all steel-consuming firms were too small to influence market prices and were forced to pay higher amounts for steel

- It became cheaper to produce steel-containing goods overseas and import them into the US, prompting businesses/consumers to order foreign-produced goods rather than domestic-produced

- The steel consuming sector had to lay off approximately 200,000 workers due to increases in steel costs and reduced business, more than the steel producing industry employs

""Look at this. This is really something!"" the student told the examiner
as he pulled the cork back out again.


""On the road again . . . Just can't wait to get on the road again . . .""


""So what?"", the Medical Examiner replied, obviously unimpressed with the
student's discovery.


""But isn't that the most amazing thing you've ever seen?"" asked the
student.


""Are you kidding?"" replied the Examiner, ""Any asshole can sing country music.""",False,False,6.0,1527853386.0,1527436599.8321111,-416786.1678888798

8nqmvm,Allllliiiii,"Give my table away and I'll never let it go, because I'm petty about food.",TalesFromTheCustomer,90215,152,152,0,35,0,"This happened a little while ago, but I'm still holding the grudge and I’m baffled by what happened, so decided to share. 

I was meeting my Dad and Step-Mum for one last lunch in the city where I live before they moved out of the country. They'd heard about a new-ish restaurant serving food and wacky cocktails, and wanted to try it out. I'd been for drinks there but not food, so was happy to give it a go. They’d only decided they wanted to go there on the day of meeting, so we weren’t able to book in advance – I warned them that this might mean we couldn’t get in there and needed to pick somewhere else, as it was quite busy when I’d been in the past, but they were happy either way. Cool, easy for me. 

I arrived before my folks and asked the FOH team if they had any tables for dining that afternoon. Luckily for us, they had a table just leaving, it’d be ready in a sec – score. I said that that’d be great, thanks very much, and the FOH team asked if I wanted to sit down at the table straight away while waiting for the other two to join me. Now, my Dad and Step-Mum are unfamiliar with the city where I live and obviously the restaurant (which isn’t very easy to find if you don't know what you're looking for) so I said “If you don’t mind, I’ll wait out front in case I need to direct them”. They said fine, so I waited just outside the doors. I should add that this isn’t a standalone restaurant – it’s inside another building, so when I say I stood outside, I was the other side of a clear glass door, feet from where we’d just been chatting, and in view of the woman I’d talked to. 

It was no more than five minutes before my folks arrived, and we immediately went into the restaurant. I went to the same woman I’d talked to before, and told her that everyone was here and we were ready to sit down please. She looked at me and said “Oh, we don’t have any tables now, it’ll be about an hour or so” – sorry, what? I was split between wanting to flip a table and trying not to be That Guy, so calmly said “I thought we could have the table that was free a mo ago?” and she replied that they gave it away because I left, and asked if we wanted to wait for the next free table. We were all hungry and I was fuming, so I lost my capability to question it any further, said no and left as politely as I could before ranting and raving to my folks as soon as we got outside. 

Did I miss something there?! I didn't realise that by not sitting down immediately, I'd forfeit the table? I didn’t put in a complaint at the time and it feels like there’s no point now as it was last year, but I still scowl in the restaurant’s direction every time I walk past.

I work 2 morning shifts a week at a cafe in a train/bus station. When you walk into the big, square building, there are three kiosks - Amtrak (train), Greyhound (bus) and John’s (cafe). Each one is clearly marked with their name and logo in their respective corners - the 4th corner has a hallway that leads to the restrooms.

What I will never understand is WHY someone will walk in the door, make a beeline for my corner, and ask me..

When is the train to ___ leaving?

What side of the platform do I stand on?

Can I bring ___ on the bus?

...etc. John’s cafe is not closest to the door. I usually wear a polo shirt and jeans, not a GREYHOUND or AMTRAK uniform. The cafe is about the size of a cat’s forehead compared to the other kiosks. My hair is pink, I’ve got tattoos, and I’ve never in my life had so many snobby, elderly people voluntarily walk up to me and treat me like I’m a treasure trove of important information.
It’s very confusing.

Today, a lady walked up to the counter, and I asked if I knew when the Greyhound employee was going to arrive.

ME: “I don’t know, I don’t work for Greyhound, I work for John’s.”

LADY: “Well it says that they open at 10am.”

ME: “Okaaay, then someone should be here at 10.”

LADY: “ITS 10AM RIGHT NOW AND
NO ONE’S THERE, MY SON HAS TO CATCH A BUS AT 10:30!”

ME: “Cool cool cool, I still don’t work for Greyhound, sooooo..” 

She turns around, stomps away, and I look at the clock. It’s 10am On.The.Dot.

Just wanted to see everyone's perspective on the fact that although Gold has always been a bottleneck, it looks like it will be even more so now with all the recent changes. If we break it down a little:

\-More gold required in purchasing items in the shop in receiving the chance of getting a premium item in Shop.

\-Significantly more gold needed in upgrading BAM for all these new awesome Uniforms.

\-Tons of Gold needed in getting all these characters to Level 70.

Solution: 

\-Revamp Villain Siege so we can acquire more Gold, instead of a measly 100k.

\-Add more CO\-OP stages \(such as 50 T2's and you receive maybe 750k instead of 450k\)

The Security guards where pleasant and had a good system for keeping the line moving so it took about 30 mins to get into Supreme, we had to show our ID and credit card and where told no phones allowed and bags to be left at the door. Once inside the store you have clothes on racks and you have to ask the staff on the shop floor if they have your size in stock and then they ask another staff member that is on a balcony above you and they check and throw it down to the staff at the bottom, so I asked if they had the playboy top in blue and medium size and was told they had completely sold out. I didn’t think much of it because it’s a hyped item, I was able to get the other stuff I liked and headed towards the line to pay. There is only one till so the time to wait is a little while so I was watching other people get their items and some kids walked up to the staff member who told me the top was sold out and fist pumped him and seemed to know him and asked if he had the blue playboy top in stock and he said yes and called up to get the group a top each. I felt that was a bit strange but maybe they found some extra stock so when I got to the till I asked them if they had any of them in stock and he called to the other staff member who looked at me and said “none in XL” and It kind of caught me off guard so I replied, “I’m looking for a medium” and he said they “sold out of all of the tops”. His comments felt really unnecessary, the whole atmosphere there felt tense and uninviting. You feel like you have to go in there quickly and get your things as fast as possible and get out, you also feel like you’re walking on eggshells and making sure you don’t touch the wrong thing or look at your phone and upset security, the staffs’ attitudes are rude and uncaring and it seems you can only get hyped items if you are buddies with them. I have read before that “the skater community is not nice and they’re supposed to be assholes” but I have a lot of skater friends who are incredibly nice and friendly and Palace around the corner from Supreme are always helpful, they strike up conversations and it feels relaxing to browse there. 
If you where thinking of going to the store on drop day and you’re traveling there, I wouldn’t bother, it’s too much hassle and the experience isn’t worth it, I think I’ll cop online for now on.

8nn5s0,dotfartoosweet,"If you're feeling stagnant, alone, and frustrated, read this to clear your mind and feel better.",socialskills,414418,951,951,0,53,4,"It's easy for the common man to throw up his hands and proclaim, ""I give up! This is worthless!"" IT takes a courageous man to say ""I am everything. With enough hard work, I will make it,"" and go on to prove it.

Right now, you are feeling frustrated and angry that your goals are not coming to fruition, and you are about to give up. Don't. Here are some words of encouragement to push you forward.

This should be obvious, but it helps to be reminded that nothing worth anything in life comes easily. It has been written many times that those who have achieved greatness failed thousands of times before they made a breakthrough. You probably haven't failed even one-hundred times. Being who you are, there is a tendency to dramatize everything, distorting reality, and eventually giving up mentally and physically. You must catch yourself in these foolish moments, and remind yourself that it could take up to a decade to master a skill. Do not be like the quitters who give up within their first year. Do not let your fear of failure overshadow your desire to be great.

There is tendency for you to procrastinate on your responsibilities because you cannot bear to be humbled by the fact your skills are more lackluster than you thought. This is the mark of a boy. A man realizes that the rewards of the long term far outweigh the situation of the present, and so he continues to set his emotions aside, and work. Work until the desired end result is achieved. For as long as the work is put in, the end result is guaranteed. Have confidence you will arrive, and soon you will.

Do not compare yourself to others. Do not worry about what others are doing. You have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, only what they present to you. How can you be sure that they are telling the truth about the amount of time it took them — for example — to get good at drawing? Or whether the work they present is their own? There isn't a way to truly know and it does not matter. Your journey is ultimately your own and as long as you are doing everything you have to do and maintaining discipline, it will take as long as it needs to for you to achieve your desired result.

Relax. There will be days of rapid progress, just as there will be periods of stagnation. Understand that both are completely normal and you shouldn't feel any intense attachment towards either. Attachment to rapid progress will form unrealistic expectations of yourself, ending in disappointment. Attachment to periods of stagnation will cause your mind to go to dark places, experience chronic frustration, and you will eventually give up.

The solution to this is to adopt an attitude of indifference. A mindset that effectively says, ""I don't care about this situation I'm in, only my goal. As long as I'm showing up everyday, I'll get there."" This attitude will help you embrace boredom, and failure more.

As previously stated, this path towards reaching your goals has left you currently frustrated and angry, and probably ready to give up. Don't. Be the courageous man that says to himself, ""I am everything,"" and sets out to prove it.",False,False,6.0,1527809541.0,1527436599.8321111,-372941.1678888798

This has been going on for about a month. Admin has been lying to parents about the bathrooms being locked down (saying it was only a couple days, that the bathrooms are open now, etc), while students have been complaining of impossible wait times at lunch and disgusting messes in those open bathrooms that go untouched for days. One student I know couldn’t find an open bathroom at school while on her period and ruined several articles of clothing. Are there any laws/educational codes against this? It’s becoming a serious stressor for my friends &amp; family who still attend this school.

Edit: I’ve linked a couple of the students who are currently documenting this to this thread to check out the advice. I graduated last year, so there’s not a whole lot I can do other than that.

Point of fact: it's been pointed out to me that TD's recent crocodile tears over the c-word are about it being applied to Ivanka - that is, the president's daughter, not his wife. I'm not entirely sure how I managed to mix those two up for long enough to put this together, but... well, the point of the post stands anyway. I just should've written ""the women of the president's family"" instead of ""a first lady"" in the title. My bad!",False,False,0.0,1527851556.0,1527436599.8321111,-414956.1678888798

8nq3d5,WellUpholsteredLady,"The ""swinging by"" battle",JUSTNOFAMILY,35493,194,194,0,17,0,"I read some posts by /u/QuickPancakes, and it reminded me of my first really big win with the in-laws. 


We all love out privacy, right? Some families, like my FHs,  have an ""open door"" policy, where everyone leaves their doors unlocked and visitors are welcome anytime. This is the story of how I put a stop to that.


When FH and I first moved in together, it was a spare bedroom at my mother's house. Then it was a teeny tiny flat, owned by a lovely older couple whose son, we later found out, was dating my older sister- so naturally they were like extended family and we saw them all the time. So when we finally got a place with room to move around in, and no relatives living literally in the next room over, we were in heaven. Freedom!!


Except, no. You see, FIL popped over one night on his way home from work, about 7.30pm, and we welcomed him in- how nice of him to come by! He stayed for an hour and left. A few nights later he did the same thing. And a few nights after that. And a few nights after that. 


For four years, FIL would show up on any random evening. Sometimes we wouldn't see him all week. Sometimes we'd see him every night for two weeks straight. Didn't matter if we had friends over, or were eating dinner, or were just on our way out, or eating junk and playing games. I begged FH to say something, anything, at least tell him to call or text first, but I was told ""That's just how our family is"". My own mother tried to visit without calling ONCE and I was firm yet polite when I informed her that wasn't appropriate. Her reaction was to offer to ""make an appointment"" next time, to which I beamed and told her it was a fantastic idea. Because boundaries and independence.


But even relaying this to FIL didn't work. Asking him directly, did not work, hinting to MIL did not work. Locking the door so he couldn't just waltz in didn't work, because if the lights were on he would knock and knock until FH opened up. I can't count the number of times I've run past the front door and up the stairs to get dressed because FIL has just *appeared*. Eventually even FH started to get annoyed by it, but still FIL was oblivious. 


So, when an opportunity landed in my lap, I took it. 


Towards the last few months of this torture, I had taken to wearing exclusively t-shirts and panties around the house. No bra for my ample bosom. No trousers. And when unexpected visitors (FIL) arrived, I would drape a blanket across my legs and apologise that I could not get them a drink, sorry, they'll have to make the visit quick, ETC. 


And then the golden moment. I was in the bath, relaxing after a hard day, and FH had gone out with a friend, so our car was still in its usual spot. And then the knocking starts. And I ignore it. And the knocking continues, and I dunk myself under the water and internally scream for at the interloper to fuck off. And then he's *hammering* on the door like there's a bloody fire or something, so I throw a towel round myself and run down the stairs, thinking a neighbour is in serious trouble.


But I can see it's FIL, and I face a choice: go get dressed? Nah. 


I flung open the door and asked what the emergency was. FIL paled. I'm in nothing but a towel. My hair is wet. There are bubbles trailing down my leg. It's. Not. A. Good. Time. He stammered, asked where FH is, and I reply curtly ""out."" I stand in the doorway, staring him down. I make a remark about beating the door down like the house is on fire. He blushes and asks if FH will be home soon, I tell him ""I don't know, FIL,  why don't you call him?"" FIL mumbles something and adverts his gaze. I offer to let him come in and wait, but I'm going back to my bath, and I shrug, letting more bathwater drip all over the carpet. FIL struggles to look me in the eye. I have the snarkiest, smirkiest raised eyebrow I can manage. I am marking my territory and my privacy. He declines to come in. I wave enthusiastically and basically slam the door.


FIL goes home. And I say nothing to FH except ""your dad stopped by but I was busy so he left.""


And it doesn't end there. A few days later we are at the ILs (called ahead like civilised folk) and MIL makes a comment about FIL going to visit us and FH not being home. FH states that no one told him to expect visitors, and MIL makes a vague suggestion that I was rude and did not invite FIL in to wait. 


So I go in for the kill. I explain that I did invite him in, but that I had been bathing, and answered the door in a towel, with bubblebath running down my legs! How funny! How embarrassing! I heard the knocking and thought it was an emergency, because *surely* no one would be that persistent! How silly of me! It's a good thing FIL didn't stay because FH took hours to come home and that would've been *so awkward!* 


FIL took me to one side and told me the story was a bit inappropriate and he'd appreciate it if I didn't repeat it. I apologised (genuinely sorry for humiliating him) and haven't had to mention it since.


FIL now visits on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 7 and 8pm. Sometimes he doesn't turn up, which is annoying, but I know when to expect him. He sometimes calls ahead to check we're in, with a snarky comment about ""oh you're not *busy*, are you?"" Sometimes I desperately want to say ""yes, actually, twice a week is a bit much, don't you think?"" But it's been three years, and as long as he sticks to his schedule or calls before he visits, I won't push it.

I live here full time so if you see this post archived.. message me and I'll hit you back with my Facebook details.

There are a few guys on Smashboards who live in Thailand \- I'll be messaging them and maybe we'll set up a discord or something, so get in touch!

Too often, I've paused writing a script to start on an idea, that simply because it's fresher, I automatically think it's better, more important, easier to complete etc, when that isn't the case. 

If you get an idea for a new film, or pilot or anything:-

Write it down, as quickly and as succintly as possible. Put as much detail as you can into it, but don't spend more than 15 minutes doing it.    

Then carry on completing what you were working on.    

Once you've completed it, maybe two three weeks or months later, then revisit the idea you had.    

Two things will have happened:    
1. You'll have completed your original script. Congratulations.

The first thing I noticed was his A$AP Rocky x Guess Tee, something that I've been scouting for the past few weeks. I complimented, knowing that shirt is hype as fuuuu if legit. He claimed he bought it from a local Facebook group. Off the bat I was thinking ""imagine if this guy was a Rep Fam"".

We got to talking, and as it turned out we had alot of the same interests; technology, hype clothing and other stuff. Then I asked the question. ""Do you use Reddit?"". 

As soon as he pulled his phone out to show me the app front and center on his home screen, I knew. 

I called him on the rep tee which was 1:1 as far as I could tell. We both had a good laugh and had an awesome conversation about reps.

It was so surreal to be speaking in person with someone from the Fam, but I'm glad I now have a mate to help QC my next haul.

Thanks for the advice my man, see you next time.

When I got there, there was a couple from out of the country who ordered 4 subs. They were being pretty rude to the lady working and seemed pretty impatient. She was the only one working.  

As she was making their last sub she looked apologetic to me and said that she will help me shortly. I was waiting for my turn for a bit at that point. I just smiled and said no worries. She was the only worker there and had to make 4 subs before mine so obviously I understood it was going to take some time. 

It is finally my turn to order but as I'm about to say something a girl who came in after me starts to order. (She clearly saw me waiting there). The subway lady said sorry but she (pointing to me) was here first. 

I finally order my sub. When I ordered, asked for toppings and paid I was just being a decent polite customer saying please and thank you. Once I got my sub I said have a nice day and left. 

When I got home I opened the bag and I realized that she slipped a cookie in there. I didn't even notice when she did it and it made my day. 

Please be nice to people who handle your food (and people in general). You might just get a free cookie.

One defendant was ancy and you could see he was ready to flee. He gets sentenced to a couple of months with felony probation following and he bolts. The bailiff radios and runs after him. He could possibly get out of the courtroom but not out of the building, so no need for a taser. I then see the bailiff hesitate and slow down. I then see why.

8nslo3,Coloradoexpress,You won’t hold the door for me? Fine.,pettyrevenge,402033,125,125,0,16,0,"For about 10 years, I was a flooring installer. I was installing carpet at a home being built by a big builder. I typically cut the big roll of carpet on the driveway, and haul in the individual rooms. I typically always leave the door closed, but not latched so that I can simply push the door open with the roll of carpet.

Now this home didn’t have stairs leading up to the front door yet, so it had a long plank from the  front sidewalk, to the door that was about 3 feet off the ground. This makes it a pain, but it’s a pretty common thing on new construction homes.  

As I was approaching the plank near the front door, the electrician came out, shutting the door behind him.  I asked him to open the door for me so that I didn’t have to set the Heavy roll of carpet down to open the door. He replied with a lecture saying “sorry, I don’t do work for free, no one in the trades should, charge for everything you can”.  He then walked back out to his trailer. This made it a little more difficult to get the carpet in the house, but I managed just fine. 

When I was walking out of the house to get my next piece of carpet, he was walking up the front walk to the door while carrying 6 or 7 light fixtures.  I made sure to latch the door in my way out.  

Of course, with his hands full, he asked me to get the door for him, and I replied “that’ll be 15 dollars, I don’t do work for free.  No one in the trades should”.  He mumbled, and grumbled, so I just kept walking. He tried opening the door with his elbow and ended up falling off of the plank, and dripping and breaking 4 lights. 

I had to go hide in my van because I was laughing so hard.  ",False,False,6.0,1527865900.0,1527436599.8321111,-429300.1678888798

My daughter looked at me funny and I said to her, ""I don't know, trees are meant for climbing.""


When the other school group left, my kid asked if she could climb. I said yes and she started climbing.

Her friends came around crying out, ""You can't climb that tree! It's a living thing!""

She kept climbing and I didn't stop her.

Now you do not get one shotted by some guardian jumping on top of you, and you are forced to use more skill to take down a enemy. One problem is that concentration and mana goes down way to fast now, since the damage is so low. But just greatly reducing the damage of every single class has made PVE a nightmare. You now need to use all your resources to take down a single enemy, which is ridiculous for a MMO.

The latter part has also caused leveling to take way longer than pre patch. To fix this you should: 1\): Either reduce the health and damage of all mobs. Or 2\): Return the damage to its previous state, or perhaps a bit less, and increase the health of all classes by 3x. With this the mobs damage should also increase.

This patch has turned this MMO way to hardcore for the average player who bought this game. Please fix.

8nsfx2,raistlinthewiz,"Dear Funcom, this is why you have to fix your server/backend code",ConanExiles,23569,78,78,0,41,0,"First of all as an introduction to my discussion, I'm a software developer who got a DMCA warning letter from one of the major game developer companies \(name starting with a 'B'\) for developing an open source emulator server software for one of their popular games.

\-\-\-

Conan Exiles is a great game. I've been playing it since the release and have already committed 238 hours since then.

Personally for me, it's more of a sandbox game then a survival and as a sandboxer and PvP oriented guy \(whom put tremendous amount of time in Albion Online, Ultima Online and so\) I'll be willing to spend more of my gaming time in Conan Exiles.

Yet again I think the client is well optimized, game design is quite good but one thing that greatly annoys me is about your poorly performing backend/server software.

As it's a proprietary software we can't really see the code / technology and comment on it but still as I've the skills to reverse engineer &amp; develop an emulator server for games \(though I've not started doing so for Conan Exiles :\) \) I've two cents to throw purely based on the game\-client's debug info &amp; feeling of the gameplay.

[https://image.ibb.co/ix9UVy/Untitled.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/ix9UVy/Untitled.jpg)

First for better understanding of other peeps, you can basically press '**Insert**' while ingame which will open the console.  Then you can basically type '**ToggleDebugHUD**' to see the panel.

So this panel basically provides us the following data;

Ping: my educated guess is that instead of a ICMP ping this is based on the game's own protocol's ping\-pong commands.

Server FPS: I think Funcom has poorly named the label as 'Server FPS' but it's should be better named 'Server Ticks'. For the who don't know what it means, it's basically like what we have  for GPU's;  'Frames Per Second' that your gpu can draw on your monitor. Similarly, server ticks means **ticks per second** that the backend/server can handle.

A 'tick' is unit time a server can completely handle all the changes &amp; perform the needed actions in a game world.

Normally in gaming world we are used to a minimum of 20 ticks per second \- where the server code can update the world 20 times in a second and then notify the clients about it. \(Note that it's not always necessary for server to notify the clients in the same rate. It can handle the ticks in a higher rate like 20 tics/sec but choose to notify the clients like 5 times per second. It's also usual to throttle clients based on their ingame region/actions performed\)

In the last years, we have seen companies like Blizzard to introduce **60 ticks/sec gameplay for Overwatch** and **DICE even achieved 100 ticks/sec with Battlefield 4 servers even in 2014 for 64 players**. Given that Battlefield has complex projectile math, you can easily achieve better for Conan Exiles compared to its current poor performance.

So for the ones whom don't know what I talk about is; those rubberbands, laggish &amp; teleporting  thralls &amp; NPC's is basically caused by this.

Yet, I'm aware that the poorly developed server software may not be the only reason for the current situation as service provider for your server's may be the root cause. If g\-portal has deployed more server instances than their hardware can handle, even if your server code is all good, extreme context switching or insufficient resources may be the cause.

So personally  I expect Funcom to confirm the problem at first \-\- basically informing us about the cause \(the server code or service provider?\) .

Then **before developing any kind of DLC / content / fix or whatever, please fix this major issue**. Rubberbanding in any kind of PvP/multiplayer game is **#1 reason you'll loose players** \(which you are already so!\)

With the current state of your server code / server provider, the game's combat system \(including PvP/PvE\) is literally unplayable.

Hopefully hearing from you guys about a potential fix will a good enough for us to be patient. And opening more server's and limiting the game to 40 online player's is really not a solution for this. This huge map really needs more than 40 like 70 or even a hundred in similar games like Ark.

\-\-\-

Here's a little extra side note for our community.

Those ping you see in server browser is completely different than ingame ping that you'll see in ToggleDebugHUD panel. The first is basically an ICMP protocol ping where the server's host operating system will reply the request where the later one is ingame\-protocol based ping.

So that's the reason even if you see \~60ping in server browser, the ingame will feel laggish &amp; start rubberbanding.

The best way to impress a woman is “NOT” trying to impress her.

So, instead of treating a woman like she is a goddess, focus on having fun and treating her like your annoying little sister.

Why? Because when you place a woman on a pedestal and treat her like she is a queen, it shows that you have little to no value, no options with other women, and you’re just an ass-kisser who wants to get in her pants.

When you treat her like your annoying ass little sister, your interaction will be playful, and you will show her that you’re care-free, fun, and you’re not going to take shit from her.

Most men try to be perfect and super polite on a date, and instead of having an awesome date, it ends up being boring and forced.

If your date with a woman is boring as hell, you can pretty much kiss your chances of seeing her ever again, because if you're boring on a date she will assume you're boring in bed, and boring in general.

When you go on a date with a woman, you should treat her with respect, but you shouldn’t be treating her like she is your God. 

Treat her like a normal human being who has strengths and weaknesses like everybody else. Tease her and don't be afraid to make comments that might be polarizing. 

As strange as this may sound, the more you try “NOT” to impress her, the higher chance you will have of leaving a great impression.

#2 Going To A Date In A Serious Mood

This is a mistake a lot of guys make, and I used to be one of those guys. 

If you want to have a successful date, it’s best that you get yourself in a social mood before the date.

Sometimes I will go to the destination of the date early and talk to the people there to get myself in a talkative mood. 

Chances are your date probably had a long day, and the last thing she wants is to go on a date with a man who is super serious and stiff.

Loosen up. 

Listen to some loud music that pumps you up and gets you in an expressive state.

Do whatever you need to do to get out of your head and enjoy the present moment.

#3 Avoiding Eye Contact &amp; Not Being Vulnerable

It’s very difficult to create a strong connection with a woman if you’re not willing to make strong eye contact in your conversations, and you’re afraid to be vulnerable.

Strong eye contact shows a woman that you’re engaged in the conversation and the moment with her. It shows her that you’re listening to her. It shows her that you have nothing to hide. It shows her that you’re confident. When you avoid eye contact you display all the “opposite” qualities of what I mentioned above, and you will have a tough time creating a strong connection on your date.

Being vulnerable is powerful because most guys refuse to do it. Most guys try to act cool, or tough, or macho, but few traits are more cool, tough, or macho than being vulnerable.

Being vulnerable shows a woman that you have healthy emotions and you’re not afraid to show her who you really are.

However, being vulnerable should not be mistakened with being a pussy. Those are two completely different things.

Being vulnerable is about removing your “mask” and letting go of the act of trying to be cool. Being a pussy is when you just complain, bitch, and moan like a little boy.

Be vulnerable, but don’t be a pussy.",False,False,6.0,1527824018.0,1527436599.8321111,-387418.1678888798

8ns4ct,xIVWIx,[YSB] Guild Wars 2,ShouldIbuythisgame,211906,51,51,0,53,0,"**Warning \- very very long post incoming! \- formatting may be off due to the size of the post.**

**Disclaimer:** Played since launch, sitting at 2500 hours and took some breaks every now and then.

I've noticed a lot of question for MMORPGs so I decided to write up a little summary for my favorite MMO franchise **Guild Wars** and the latest game **Guild Wars 2.**

Note \- I will be tackling this as a **You should try** post since the base game is F2P.

**So why should I buy / try GW2 if I'm looking for an MMORPG?**

As mentioned above, the game is F2P but this version has restrictions.[Here](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF) you can find a table comparing F2P to the base game &amp; both expansions.You **can** play the whole base game to level 80 even with these restrictions, there's been enough examples at r/Guildwars2 confirming this.

Anyhow, there's more reason as to why you should definitely try out the free version if you're on the fence.

* Guild Wars 2 caters to both **casual** and **hardcore** players. I'm going to focus on the level of dedication and the toughness of content here.
   * **Casual**: There's no pressure to keep up with armor, no need to log in every day, ...You can play at your own pace, set your own goals, basically do whatever you prefer.Open World content can be done alone and there's no need to min\-max for this content.Dungeons aren't too hard &amp; finding groups for them is easy via the group finder.Some dungeons are a tad harder but they're perfectly do\-able with the right gear.There's no gear treadmil.The difference between exotic \(easiest and 2nd best armor tier\) and ascended gear \(the 'best' gear\) is only a 5&amp;#37; increase for said stats. Exotic armor is easily obtainable via dungeons, drops, crafting, just playing really.I'm not going to expand any further since it's pretty obvious, this game can be played very very casually in a way of difficulty and time \- you don't need to invest a lot of time to have fun!
   * **Hardcore**: People who're looking for tougher content \(than open world / dungeons\) have a multitude of options so satisfy their cravings.
      * ***Raids***: Yup, Guild Wars has raids too \- divided in wings and they're the hardest content. They're also based on mechanics and there are of course meta team compositions. Raids are cleared in parties of 10.
      * ***Fractals***: These are progressive mini\-dungeons. They're shorter than the actual dungeons but they're also divided in levels \(sort of like Mythics in WoW\). You start out at fractal level 1 and progress your way up to 100. The dungeons get harder per level and people like to clear the higher levels as fast as possible and / or solo even.
      * ***Legendaries*** :Okay, I kind of lied about the gear, ascended isn't the last tier. Legendary armor, weapons and trinkets are the last tier. There's no stat increase over ascended though!What's the difference then? Well legendary weapons have extra animations \(glows, fire, ice, ...\) and when sheathed and moving some of them kind drop drips of... your weapon. You can also change your stat combination on the fly \(whereas for exotic/ascended you would have to craft a whole new set\).Okay so fancypants weapons and the ease of changing my stats, wow that's not hardcore... Well they take quite some time to craft and assemble. Going for a legendary on it's own can be quite a time sink &amp; therefor huge goal. Casual players don't let this spook you. There's RNG involved too and just playing the game will passively net you a nice chunk of the required materials. Hardcore players just like to ""grind"" them so I included it under this section.
      * ***Achievements***:There are various achievements to be earned. Tied to the story, PvP, WvW, ... rewarding you achievement points \(AP\) &amp; some times extra rewards \(gold, armor, armor skins, ...\). Some people like to AP Hunt and gather as many AP as they can.Every 500 AP you also get a chest and some passive account bonusses \(xp gain increase, gold gain increase, ...\) .Every 5K AP you get a bigger chest with more items, more gold, a title, ...Some achievements are easy to get or just require some time \(kill X spiders\), others require more skill, patience or a mix of all of the above \(wouldn't be AP hunting otherwise\)....
* **PvE** \- I'll discuss the PvE content more here
   * **Open World \-** The open world on its own provides for quite a bit of content. GW2 doesn't really use traditional \(side\)questing. Maps are filled with **Heart quests, vistas, points of interest &amp; dynamic events.**
      * **Heart Quests** can be found on the map and are automatically ""active"" once you enter the vicinity. On the top right corner you'll see how you can progress these and once they're done you get rewarded without having to even talk to an NPC. There is however always an NPC that becomes a vendor once you complete a heart quest. These sell a variety of things \- not always useful but still good to know.
      * **Vistas** are kind of like towers in assassins creed. They don't reveal the map more but they give you a cinematic view of the area/landscape and they also count for your map completion.
      * **POIs** \(points of interest\) are your standard landmarks and sometimes landmarks from GW1. Interesting zones, buildings, ruins, ... They also count for map completion.
      * **Dynamic events** can pop up at any time \(some have fixed cooldowns\) and anyone running around can participate. They're pretty fun and a very good way to level inbetween heart quests and a good way to keep things interesting.
      * **There's also Event chains**. They're basically multiple events chained to one another.There's just so much to do in the open world apart from all this but this is actual content.
   * **Dungeons**
      * Your standard 5\-man dungeon that has 2 ""modes"".
      * *Storymode* \(mandatory to finish these to start your own exploration mode group\). These are tied to the story and as soon as your eligible to do these, you'll get a mail ingame.
      * *Exploration mode* is where it's at though. The dungeons get harder and they get divided into 3 paths \- you choose \(as a party\) which path you'll do somewhere at the start of the dungeon.You can only do 1 path per time so you can basically gain rewards for the same dungeon 3 times and you get a bonus if you clear all 3 once per day.These dungeons give you dungeon tokens and gold. The tokens can be used to buy those dungeons' armor sets \(they all have their own skins and 3 stat combinations to choose between\).
   * **Personal Story**This is basically your main quest. This is in the form of a more traditional questing system \( a questlog, NPCs to talk to, ...\) and actually has a story/advances your character in the story. The story overall isn't *super* but it ain't bad either.HOWEVER Arenanet has decided to continue developing the story via the Living World Story. The living world is **basically extra FR**EE content we get every x weeks \(Schedule varies\) that keep advancing the story after the base game and the seasons are also tied and sometimes in between the expansions. They add new maps, missions/quests, achievements, armor, ...They really want to keep the world alive and the story advancing which is very very nice.
   * **Fractals**
   * **Raids**\(as explained above\)
* **PVP**I actually find the PvP very enjoyable.It's a domination/conquest type of game mode and can be played \(un\)ranked and solo or duo. You **don't** need to be max level to play.You can create a character, do the intro and immediately port to the lobby.PvP gear is based on stat trinkets &amp; runes that are the same for everyone. You get most of them on the fly \(at least the popular ones\), some you have to ""pay"" for with gold but it isn' much and it's usually very specific \(less used\) runes and such.The beauty of PvP is that you can\*\* earn PvE rewards via rew**ard tracks. That way you can still go for that legendary or a specific \(dungeon\*\) **armor se\*\*t even if you only play PVP.
* **WvW** \(World vs. World vs. World\)In this gamemode 3 servers face off against eachother over 4 maps.This is basically a teamed open world PvP gamemode. You have to control as many towers, keeps, supply camps as you can over the span of the 4 maps. The more you control, the more points you get. You basically want to win your match\-ups for ... honor.Just like in PvP you can also activate reward tracks for extra loot. Killing players and NPCs in WvW will of course also get you loot, but seeing as there are less NPCs to kill and more players \(which is harder\) you won't necessarily gain loot as fast as in PvE.There's usually a commander leading the map. This is a person with a blue Dorito above his head who's either leading 49 other people off of a cliff or leading them to capture a keep or fight another commander.

Seeing as the game modes already took quite a write\-up I'll try to emphasize other selling points and keep it as short as I can.

* **Fashion Wars**:
   * Collecting armor &amp; skins can also be a huge timesink if that's what you like. There's plenty of armor, weapon &amp; backpack skins to collect as well as armor dyes for extra crispy dye combination.
* **Miniatures**:
   * Kind of like pets but completely useless, you can have 1 mini running behind you. These are also collectable &amp; some main characters have a mini. So you could have anything from spiders, cats, raid bosses or important NPCs in the form of a mini.
* **Seasonal events**:
   * During Winter for example there's the wintersday event, Halloween there's The Mad King who usually pays a visit and in April there's Super Adventure Box \(this one is *really* loved by the community\). They appear every year and add extra content spread over the world of Guild Wars 2. They add extra achievements and collectables during that time.
* **The community**:
   * Is just amazing and very welcoming. Just check r/Guildwars2 and find out for yourself.There's been an influx of new players \(due to the Bless online fiasco\) so it's also a good time to get started! Also due to **megaservers** no map will ever be empty and starter maps usually have veterans running around helping other people.Via the group\-finder you can also find parties who're doing certain events on a certain map.
* **Combat**:
   * The combat is dynamic \(dodge\-rolling \+ underwater combat\) and engaging \(especially in harder fractals / raids\).You get 5 skills per weapon / weapon combination.Every 2 handed weapon gets 1 set of 5 skills \(differs per class of course\)&amp; every mainhand weapon gets 3 and the off\-hand weapon gets 2 skills.You get 1 healing skill \(slot 6\) &amp; 3 utility skills \(you can swap these\) and finally an elite skill \(can also swap between multiple elites\). You unlock elite &amp; utility skills when leveling.Every class has multiple utility and elite skills.
* **Classes &amp; professions**
   * Classes can choose between professions \(professions are more specialized &amp; the expansion packs are necessary to play these\).I will always include the professions in the order of the expansions.The first expansion is Heart of Thorns &amp; the second is Path of Fire.
   * [Elementalist](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elementalist)
      * is your elemental mage that can wield a staff, daggers, a sceptre and a focus.They have skills related to the elements \(fire, earth, water, air\) &amp; are mainly DPS\-focussed but can also function as a support \(in WvW mainly\).
      * Possible professions for Elementalist are [Tempest ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tempest)\(DPS focus\) &amp; [Weaver ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weaver)\(also DPS focus\).Tempest focusses more on extra crit damage and such while Weaver allows you to combine your elements \(so water \+ fire would give you steamy skills of some sort\).
   * [Ranger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ranger)
      * Well, your typical ranger \- pet basically. At its core a DPS class with Longbow, Shortbow, 2H sword, 1H sword, Axe, Horn. You can also tame pets to unlock more and pets can be controlled to some extent \(mainly their attacks\).
      * Professions are [Druid ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Druid)\(support focus\) &amp; [Soulbeast ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soulbeast)\(DPS focus\).Druids mainly rely on astral forces to heal and support allies while also still providing good DPS.Soulbeast rangers ""absorb"" the soul of their pet and gain their skills as well as other bonusses.
   * [Warrior](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warrior)
      * Your typical Leroy Jenkins. A tougher melee DPS class that can wield 2H weapons, maces, axes, swords, shields, ...
      * Their professions are [Berserker ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Berserker)\(focus on DoT DPS or condition damage\) &amp; [Spellbreaker ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spellbreaker)\(focus on DPS and stripping buffs\).
   * [Necromancer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Necromancer)
      * Your minion spawning, curse and condition \(poison, burning, bleeding\) generating spawn of darkness. They mainly focus on DoTs but can also be utilized as pure DPS. They cast curses and spells that take down targets by applying a mass of conditions as well as stripping buffs from enemies \(believe me, this is big\).
      * Their professions are [Reaper ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reaper)\(DPS/DoT, *can be run as both*\) and [Scourge ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reaper)\(DoT and Support\).
   * [Engineer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Engineer)
      * Your turret, bombkit wielding tinkerer. Mainly a DPS class that can wield either a rifle, a pistol &amp; shield or double pistol set\-up. They don't have as many weapon combinations but they can run bomb / mine kits that replace weapon skills with new kit skills. They're a bit more complex to play but definitely fun to do so.
      * Their professions are [Scrapper ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scrapper)\(DPS/Bruiser\) &amp; [Holosmith ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Holosmith)\(more glassy DPS\).
   * [Mesmer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mesmer)
      * Your arcane illusionist. Mainly a DPS class but can also be run as a DoT or Support class.They rely heavily on multiple Phantasms or Clones to deal damage. They can spawn up to 3 Phantasm / clones and *shatter* them for extra damage.
      * Their professions are [Chronomancer ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chronomancer)\(DPS/Support\) &amp; [Mirage ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirage)\(DPS/DoT\).
   * [Guardian](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guardian)
      * Your tankier class at its core. They're divine warriors that focus on supporting the party with shouts but they can also deal significant damage if you spec them that way. They are very much favored in WvW \(they're buff dispensers\).
      * Their professions are [Dragon Hunter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonhunter) \(DPS &amp; favorable in PvP\) &amp; [Firebrand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Firebrand) \(More support\-like\).
   * [Thief](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Thief)
      * Your Glass assassin class. Guess what, these are DPS\-focussed of course *but* can also run DoT builds. They rely heavily on backstabs and stealthing for damage and are squishier than a warrior for example. Know when to hit and who to hit!
      * Their professions are [Daredevil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daredevil) \(bit tankier, still DPS\) &amp; [Deadeye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deadeye) \(DPS, sniper\).
   * [Revenant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Revenant)\(Heart of Thorns expansion required\)
      * Revenants are a new class that got introduced with the HoT expansion.They're warriors/assassins from the Mists and rely heavily on stances/auras that they gained from Legends that now reside in the Mists. They're a bit squishier than warriors hence why I also included assassin in the description. They can warp through the Mists for teleported attacks and can swap between 2 stances during combat. They also share buffs which is a nice extra and favorable in PvE.
      * Since they got introduced in HoT they only have 1 extra profession \(which comes with Path of Fire expansion\). This being [Renegade ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Renegade)*\(DPS\).*

I'm going to start rounding up this already too big wall of text &amp; just end with some practical information. If you decide to try the game and like it, you don't need to buy the base game as it is included in any of both expansions.So you can upgrade your F2P account by buying either Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire. The expansion packs however are to be bought separately **but they go on sale pretty often.**

Dear Aaron-

You got away again this time. Both you and that luscious little Bonnie of yours.

Does it bother you when I call her luscious? I imagine it does. But it’s such a wonderful, delicate way of describing the intricate web that the three of us share. 

We’re delicious together.

I love the game. Can you choose a different route to her kindergarten class every day? You get so creative when trying to elude me. I *do* admire the perseverance. I noticed the way you slipped into that alley after spotting me and hid with Bonnie in the dumpster. I could have caught you both that day. 

Instead, I strangled a stray dog and tossed his corpse in there in the trash with you two. Has that traumatized your daughter?

There were many opportunities to end the hunt. But what are the attributes of an ideal quarry? The answer, of course, is that it must have courage, cunning, and, above all, it must be able to reason.

So I let you and Bonnie go that morning. You moved to another state, as you had eleven different times that year. It took me three weeks of obsessive searching before I found you once again, that time in Las Cruces, New Mexico. You had run so far!

I love seeing your life fall apart, Aaron. You have given up everything in trying to protect Bonnie from me. You’ve lost all your family and friends, who have no idea where you are.

Believe me, they would have told me if they knew. The human mind can only endure so much physical mutilation before it gives up all its secrets.

Every one of them is gone. I love knowing that you had to stop attending their funerals so that you could stay hidden from me. 

You didn’t miss anything at your father’s service. Trust me, I was there. There wasn’t even an open casket. No point, I suppose, if his body has been turned to puree.

So now everything is your daughter’s safety. Your entire existence is based on keeping her safe. You have nothing else. 

Have you really accepted that she will die one day? The entirety of human existence is *nothing* more than delaying the inevitable, and Death has a one hundred percent success rate. 

You will fail.

_________________

**Elm Grove Police Department** 

**Evidence Item No.** 060120181913

**Incident Type:** Suicide

**Coroner’s Conclusion:** Aaron [redacted] died of asphyxiation after choking on his own vomit. Stomach contents revealed 200 mg of benzodiazepine, which supports the theory of death by suicide. 

Due to the presence of vomit in Aaron [redacted]’s lungs, it is believed that he survived and was conscious for 60-120 minutes after the initial ingestion, but was unable to avoid asphyxiation due to loss of muscle control. 

**Notes:** The attached note (Evidence Item No. 060120181913) was found clutched in Aaron [redacted]’s hand. 

While no suicide note was discovered, Elm Grove Police strongly suspect that the victim was distraught over recent developments involving his daughter, Bonnie [redacted]. After she was taken from his apartment while Aaron [redacted] was defecating, an intense three-week search revealed no suspect. The suicide victim’s mental state had deteriorated significantly in his final days, as his daughter’s body parts were delivered to his apartment through various package delivery companies. 

Initial deliveries included all ten fingers, all ten toes, a gall bladder, an appendix, eleven teeth, three feet of intestine, and a surgically removed kidney.

Medical professionals examined each delivery and determined them to be in vivo removals, leaving hope for a live recovery of the girl. 

Aaron [redacted] had to be forcibly sedated after the final delivery, which was made approximately three hours before the alleged suicide took place.

That delivery included his daughter’s severed face, along with a note reading “she’s sill [alive](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

I swallowed, and felt a sharp, stabbing pain run down the side of my throat. Not like normal food got stuck in my throat pain, but more like a searing pain as if a sharp knife had just been plunged through the side of my neck. I came home, and after playing video games for a bit, went to bed. When I woke up this morning, the pain was much worse than it had been last night. I have a stabbing pain in the side of my throat every time I swallow, and I've had to text everything to my employees this morning because I've partially lost my voice and they couldn't hear me on the phone.

I am currently sitting in a hospital bed, waiting on a CAT scan to see if I've actually damaged anything in there. I've broken bones, been in two major car accidents, had two collapsed lungs, and a host if other emergent room visits. This is by far the dumbest thing that has ever happened to me.

Edit: they just made me drink a mixture of mylax and lidocaine. That was disgusting, but at least it doesn't hurt quite as much to swallow. Still waiting for CAT scan. 

TL;DR  Ate chicken wings last night. Now sitting in hospital waiting on a CAT scan to see if I've damaged my throat. 

Update:  CAT scan does not show anything stuck in my throat. Doctor believes it was either punctured or cut by a piece of chicken bone. Antibiotics to prevent infection for now, follow up in a few days unless the pain continues to worsen. Most expensive chicken wings ever. 

Update 2:  started antibiotics and a steroid. Have to avoid spicy foods, or anything else that could possibly irritate it for a bit, but overall it's better than it could have been. Pain meds are helping too. :)",False,False,1.0,1527854590.0,1527436599.8321111,-417990.1678888798

No one cares how many ""scene points"" you get with your Cusco show cage, it will not save your life on a track even if you car only has 200 HP.",cars,620351,140,140,0,89,0,"As summer is upon us I think it's time to revisit a brief safety tip that everyone should know before venturing out onto the track. This post is aimed more at the crowd that has modified their cars less so than the ones with showroom stock ± minor bolt ons, but has information and links to more information that is beneficial to both groups.

You may have seen the brand ""Cusco"" around. They're a pretty big name, particularly in Japan tuning. However, do not be led astray by their shiny show parts because that's all they're good for: show.  [Tragedy could have been avoided if the owner of the purple Altezza had a proper cage or even rollbar installed.](http://i.imgur.com/XMeJHaF.jpg). [This](http://www.cuscousainc.com/products/roll-cage/d1-rollcage.html) is the roll ""cage"" that the owner had installed. Note that is not advertised as an FIA-certified cage for racing.

Cusco does make a [couple](http://www.cuscousainc.com/products/roll-cage/safety-21-rollcage.html) of [FIA-compliant](http://www.cuscousainc.com/products/roll-cage/fia-asn-rollcage.html) roll cages. The Safety 21 cage is designed for cars with most of its interior, and the ASN cage is design for gutted track cars. **However, I still would not recommend the Safety 21 cage because there should** ***never*** **be [open bolts at hinge points](http://www.cuscousainc.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/317x/9a109bd5ea97eb39be5b2e97a1a0c9ab/s/a/safety21.jpg) in any roll cage or bar.**

If you want to keep yourself safe on the track in your street car, I highly suggest looking to a roll bar made by one of the following FIA and/or SCCA-approved manufacturers:

Since my family has every iPhone from the 4 to the 8, I decided to compare video qualities between them. We keep them just incase one of our phones break. I snapped a picture of all the iPhone boxes stacked up, from big to little, and posted it on Instagram. This guy had the nerve to FaceTime me (I gave him my number at one point in time years ago) and say this: 

Guy: Hey [name] what’s going on?

Me: Oh nothing much. Just trying to catch up on some homework. What about you? 

Guy: I’m trying to get some rest. I’ve been working hard all day cleaning out basements from that big flood that happened, trying to get some money to feed the fam. Mimi (his grandmother) is getting real sick, and the whole bottom floor of her house got flooded. So I gotta get that done to. It’s so hard getting any money, we might not have food for the next three days.

Me: That’s not good. How-

Guy: Yeah I hurt my leg real bad the other day, so I’ve been limping around trying to clean for people so we can eat. I can’t wait to get food. I lost my phone the other day in the creek, and I can’t call my mom to tell her how I’ve been. 

Me: I’m so sorry. I didn’t know times were that rough.

Guy: Well, anyway I was on your Instagram, and I saw that picture. I was wondering...maybe you can help me out, and possibly give me one of those phones.

Me: (being naive and to generous) Ok, I have an iPhone 5 I can ship to you. The screen messes up from time to time, but I’ll have to ask my dad since it’s his. He shouldn’t care though, since it just sits around collecting dust. 

Guy: Oh...um I was hoping you could give me something newer than that. Like an 8? 

Me: Uh...I’m sorry but everything else is in use right now. (My dad has a 6, my mom has an 8 plus like me, my 2 sisters each have the 7, and my other sister has an 8.) But, I can send you the 5-

Guy: What do you mean in use?

Me: Like the people they were bought for are still using them. 

Guy: Ok, can’t you give me yours? 

Me: lol what? 

Guy: Yeah. Just give me yours, and then you can give me 2 more later on for my brother and my friend. 

Me: No, I don’t think I can do that.

Guy: Why not?

Me: Because what would I use? Plus, they aren’t all mine.

Guy: Well, your dad can just buy you a new one. 

Me: No he can’t. Like I said, I can give you the 5 but- 

Guy: Nah scratch that. You should give me an iPhone from the store. You know so it won’t have finger prints on it, and then get the other 2.

Me: I never said I was giving you 3 iPhones. Just one, and definitely not brand new. 

Guy: but, my leg is hurt real bad, and I can’t work without them. 

Me: I don’t care. I said one and one only, and now I don’t even know if I want to give you it. 

Guy: Ugh fine. Just send the 5 here. I may get $30 out of it...what about your Xbox? 

Me: What about it?

Guy: Well, I need to get my nephew a birthday present and he really wanted one.

Me: I’m not giving you my Xbox. 

Guy: You’re such a stupid selfish princess bitch you know that? You get everything bought for you, and you’re so privileged. You don’t have to work like me.

Me: Excuse me? I worked and saved for both of the things you just asked me for! My parents didn’t help me get those things at all! It took me 1 year to get them! 

Guy: Whatever, I expect what I asked for to be sent here by next week, or there will be hell to pay.

Me: Bet I won’t. *I hung up on him*

I worked so hard at this job, and over the years it became so stressful to where I was making myself sick. I couldn’t enjoy vacations because I was worried about work, I couldn’t enjoy weekends because I was worried about work. I couldn’t enjoy marriage fully because I was worried about work. I woke up every day hoping I would be in some terrible accident so that I wouldn’t have to go in. 

I buckled down and started interviewing at places. Eventually I found a great fit that wanted me ASAP. I took a long time to think about it, took a long hard look at life and my mental and physical health. I made the decision officially  today and just sent in my resignation. I am starting my new job tomorrow without notice to my current employer. 

I am nervous and scared, but I know this was right for me in the long run. This is what’s better for me. I just hope I can be as good at this new job to live happy. I think that getting out of a terribly toxic place will do wonders for my motivation and health. 

I’m scared. I’m nervous. I have the support of my wife and family as they’ve watched what that place did to me.

So there was a girl at my school who died in a car crash. She was a good person, smart, but I didn't know her. I had never talked to her, never sat in a group with her, etc. Not because I didn't like her, but because I'm not a social person. We had one class together before she died. I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, when they told us at the beginning of the day that she had died, I didn't recognize the name. It wasn't until I got to that class that I learned who it was. So basically we sit there for the entire hour, I say a silent prayer out of respect for her, but I mostly just stare at my desk. Later in the day, I start to get some hate from other people in that class, because I was the only one who didn't cry. They said stuff about how I was heartless and need to be more respectful to the dead. I never knew her, I shouldn't be forced to cry over her death. Very few people in that class had reason to cry over her death, because she hadn't been very social. Two days later everybody was fine except for her actual friends. Everybody else was just being fake, and they all knew it. They pretended to grieve because that's what everybody else was doing.

Today’s #TGIFridays is a continuation of Andrew’s #MemberChatMonday. For the first time he showed off the device his dad made to give him back the ability to play the kick drum. They call it THE HAMMER. Here is its action movie debut!

“I wanted to give people a visual of how The Hammer works. I can tell you that BY FAR, this is more comfortable than using my prosthesis. There’s a lot to work on. I physically can’t produce as much power and control as I can with a trusty ol’ REAL leg/foot/ankle combo. Mostly other musicians will notice that during the part where I switch the groove to the open hats. Because I only have a very short limb, there is also a timing/latency issue when striking The Hammer with my limb to the kick head that I think is just going to get better with more practice and experience. It’s honestly like having to relearn how to play drums again. The muscle memory is there, but my body is drastically different. Going to experiment with triggers to see if that helps my situation. To be honest with you, I’m fine with having an excuse to use triggers. I’m a huge fan, they sound badass and I love death metal 😁. So here it is. The first official footage of THE HAMMER 🔨 🤙🏻”

Kyle frowned as Octavian drove on in the moonlight. He hadn’t thought the opposing Commander would reveal his plot so quickly. 

*No,* he swiftly realized. *This is only a part of it.* 

Octavian was manipulating him, just like he had done to so many others. The long-standing Commander was determined to remain on the show no matter the consequences. 

*Not this time. The writers have spoken. Octavian will die at my hand.*

Kyle had traveled the path to King Ender’s castle only once before, as a foot soldier in the failed assault of season three. It had been the closest King George had ever come to victory, advancing into King Ender’s territory after unveiling a brilliant new battle tactic. Octavian had led a valiant charge from Ender’s castle during the night which had caught King George’s troops by *surprise*. 

It had been one of the most extensive battles in the history of the show, leaving hundreds *dead* on either side. The producers had been forced to feed massive burial pyres for nearly a week to maintain the illusion of the war. Even now, Kyle still wondered what fuel they had used to keep them going. Miranda had advised him not to question such things.  

“What do you mean by that?” Kyle asked a moment later. 

Octavian produced a stack of paper from inside his bag and waved it mockingly in front of the bars of Kyle’s mobile prison. “There’s been a change to the script.”

*Of course. I’ll bet I’m the one who has to die now.*

“No one told me.” Kyle kept his voice level. Once, his tone would have betrayed his inner turmoil, but after a few years playing the Commander he could manage the feat. Until he understood the other man’s plan, it would be best to play along. 

“That’s because the writers couldn’t afford to let everyone know the truth,” Octavian explained as the path began to wind into the mountains. “I didn’t even believe it myself at first.” 

Kyle eyed the *soldier* skeptically. “The truth?” 

“We’ve entered the final season of the show. This storyline will end the war once and for all. Obviously, I’d let you see the script if I could, but you’ll have to believe my word for now.”

Kyle was thankful for the darkness to hide his shocked expression. The end of the show? Did Octavian honestly expect him to believe that? 

“Explain yourself.” 

“I’m sure you noticed that this storyline is out of the ordinary,” Octavian went on in his smooth voice. “We’ve only come to this point because King Ender has forced the writers’ hand. Truthfully, it was only a matter of time before one of them grew tired of the endless war. 

“You see, King Ender ordered me to push on after our latest victory, no matter the costs. Even after I told him King George had sent reinforcements and held the advantageous ground, he wouldn’t change his mind. This imprisonment storyline was the writers’ way to temporarily placate him. It was only in rewrites that they realized the real opportunity at hand.”

“Your … *ascent*, I’m guessing?”

“Exactly. The writers have decided to kill off King Ender and install me in his place.”

Kyle’s jaw dropped. It was even worse than he thought. Octavian hadn’t just talked the writers into allowing him to survive their looming battle, he had somehow convinced them to make him King. It was a storyline that would never work…

*It can’t be the writers*, Kyle realized. *This is all Octavian. He’s gone completely insane. I can’t let him succeed.*

Kyle had always believed the show would eventually end, but he would not let Octavian end it prematurely. He would not let the selfish man restart the war that had nearly ended the world just because he couldn’t stand to have his character written off!

Taking a deep breath, Kyle calmed himself. He had to hear out the *new* script to understand how he could save the show. “What do I have to do?” 

Octavian hesitated. “You … actually believe me?”

“Of course,” Kyle nodded, “I know you speak with the writers. That’s the only way you could have survived this long, right? It makes sense that they would want this twist to remain a surprise. It will change everything.”

“Exactly,” Octavian replied, once again the pinnacle of confidence. A lesser actor probably wouldn’t have noticed his slight hesitation the moment before. 

“So, what do I need to do?” 

“The beginning of the scene is unchanged,” Octavian explained, “You’ll still be imprisoned, and you’ll still be freed by one of King George’s *spies* within the castle. Only now, instead of trying to escape, you will confront the King…”

As Octavian explained his self-created rise to power, Kyle rested his bound hands atop the knife he had taken from the set. He would not let Octavian end the show before its time. It was his duty to maintain the peace for as long as possible. 

If that meant actually killing Octavian, then so be it.

8nq2k4,french_panpan,Les publicités au cinéma,france,194058,251,251,0,227,0,"3615Mavie : 

Ces derniers temps la ribambelle de publicités et bandes annonces avant le début de la séance me donnait l'impression d'être de plus en plus longue, donc j'ai commencé à regarder l'heure du début du film par rapport à l'heure annoncée pour voir combien de temps ça durait et s'il y a une évolution dans le temps.

Sur les 3 derniers mois (en excluant hier soir, j'y viens après), c'était toujours entre 23 et 25 minutes, donc relativement stable.  
J'ai pas de chiffres sur avant, donc difficile à dire s'il y a vraiment une augmentation par rapport à l'an dernier, par contre, on peut constater que sur un film de 1h40, ça représente 1/4 de la longueur du film, ce qui me semble considérable.  
Vous imaginez aller sur n'importe quel site de vidéo et vous taper 2min30 de pub sans le bouton ""skip"" pour **chaque** vidéo de 10 minutes ? **Et en plus payer pour ce service ?**  
J'ai plus la télévision pour vérifier par moi même, mais apparemment [c'est limité à 2 coupures de 6 minutes](http://www.csa.fr/Television/Le-suivi-des-programmes/Les-communications-commerciales/La-publicite), donc la moitié du cinéma, et on paye pas 10 boules la place.

Hier soir, je suis entré dans la salle de cinéma pas trop tard pour avoir une bonne place pour une séance à 20h45, et le film a commencé à ... 21h19, soit 34 minutes de publicité.   
34 minutes c'est très long.  
Pour dire, ils ont même passé 2 fois la bande annonce de Jurassic World (rires nerveux dans la salle quand les gens ont remarqué).  

Vous en pensez quoi des publicités au cinéma ? Les publicités sont aussi longues par chez vous ? Quel est le meilleur moyen de signaler mon mécontentement au cinéma (je pense qu'une plainte au caissier n'ira pas plus loin que son oreille) ?

Maybe I do the same thing and I just don't realise, but I'd like to think I treated everyone equally. My looks have changed dramatically since I was 16. (I'm 18 now). I don't believe anyone is truly ugly; it's all subjective but I was considered conventionally ugly and after doing stuff for ME (eg losing weight to be healthy, using products to stop painful spots) I'm considered conventially attractive. 

Women don't really treat me any differently. Boys used to treat me badly. They would ask me out as a joke, call me ugly, if there was a group of boys they'd be like to one of them ""oh look there's your girlfriend"" and the guy would be like ""EWWWWW"". Even grown men would stop me on the streets and say ""you need to lose some weight, love"".


Now men hold open doors, look at me, smile, treat me with respect that was never there among other things. One man even wanted me to be part of what looked like some seedy photo shoot. Some boys who I thought were friends when I was ""ugly"" have stopped talking to me for rejecting their advances. It's just disgusting. I should be respected because I'm a person, not because my waist shrunk by a few inches or my skin got nicer ect.


Sorry if someone believes this is a humble brag because it truly isn't. I hear so many men justifying this by saying ""men are visual creatures"".

I do think she gets a better edit because she is friends with Andy Cohen.

Also, incase you weren’t aware, she was best friends with JFK jr. and his wife, married to a prince and apparently the only person who has ran a marathon...

Look, I know RHONY has a lot of crazies, but Carole’s entitled attitude really annoys me. At least the other ladies are aware they are on a show and don’t act like they are above it.",False,False,6.0,1527852812.0,1527436599.8321111,-416212.1678888798

It’s the first day of hurricane season, so ask me anything about hurricanes, what it’s like reporting during a hurricane, Katrina, or the city of New Orleans’ levee system and storm prep.
 
**A little about me:** I’ve been covering New Orleans’ hurricanes and its levee system for 34 years, including the 2002 series, “[Washing Away](http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/page/washing_away_2002.html),” which described the system’s inability to withstand major storms three years before Hurricane Katrina.
 
After Katrina, I outlined the reasons for the levee failures that destroyed tens of thousands of homes in metro New Orleans, including my own. Since then, I have been covering the reconstruction of the levee system and future plans to improve it. I also cover the state’s 50-year, $50 billion Master Plan for coastal restoration and hurricane protection. And I am the co-author of the 2006 book, “[Path of Destruction: The Devastation of New Orleans and the Coming Age of Superstorms](https://www.amazon.com/Path-Destruction-Devastation-Orleans-Superstorms/dp/031601642X).”

8nshgk,DummyThiccc,Little Person - Big Problem,stopdrinking,115563,57,57,0,8,0,"I’m a Little Person (LP) and today marks 160 days sober for me. Little People can often have a really shitty stereotype. We’re known for partying, taking stupid jobs only based on our size, and allowing people to laugh at us in hopes that it helps us fit in. A lot of LPs depend on alcohol to get by and it’s really unfortunate. I can’t tell you how many times I was the “drunk midget” in the room, and knowing that’s what I was is something I still have a hard time facing to this day. What I thought was helping me deal with the looks, laughs, and awkwardness was actually making it worse. People always notice the drunk guy more. Waking up in the clubs I partied at the night before was a common occurrence and not knowing how I got home from the night before was even more. Going out and blacking out with my friends was the answer to a lot of my problems. 

“Somebody’s looking at me? What do I care?!”
“Somebody just took a picture of me on their camera phone? What do I care?!”

I had some really close calls before I sobered up and I’m lucky to be where I’m at today. Somebody once told me that “dodged bullets and wake up calls are the same thing... It just how you choose to look at them.” I couldn’t agree with this more. 

I’m making this post because I wanted to share my journey and express how healthy it is rediscovering a life without booze. I have a great career and just bought my own condo. There’s no way I could have done this if I was still on the booze. Realizing I don’t NEED alcohol for anything has been arguably the best experience of my life. My friends said they like me better without it, I see my family more, and I’m not really ashamed of anything I’m doing these days (I’m still a professional wrestling fan and I’ll never change that for anyone. haha!). I hope a lot of you realize how much better things can be living sober because I certainly have.

8nstbc,Shauncore,Takeaways from Micron's Analyst Day,wallstreetbets,260571,83,83,0,29,0,"* Micron management discussed the current bull cycle in memory, based on
 * AI
 * Enterprise solutions
 * Tight chip supply (production bottlenecks)
 * Micron specific attributes: DRAM shrink at 10-18nm nodes without EUV, 3D NAND leadership with QLC 64/96 layers, differentiation and full-line up with X-Point, NOR flash
* $10B buyback fueled through at least 50% FCF, starting in September
* Raised guidance for 3Q 2018 of $7.7-7.8B and $3.12-3.16 EPS; due to higher ASP (higher DRAM prices, low corrections in NAND prices)

* Price/cost improvements based on
 * commercialization of QLC (4 bits per cell) 3D NAND ahead of competitors (as of 2Q18)
 * 1ynm DRAM die shrink (production starting 2H)
 * hyperscale enterprise memory modules (TB level of SSD and server/graphic DRAM already actively shipped), etc. 
 * disciplined capex (low 30% of sales) and wafer capacity expansion); new clean room space will be used for
new tech migration (96-layer 3D, 1Ynm node, etc)  
 * Multi-patterning based DRAM die shrink even for 10nm nodes or above (1znm, 1α, 1β). 
 * Micron's limited chip supply (DRAM bit growth 20% pa or less: NAND 40% range) and new targets for shareholder returns suggests upside catalysts for other memory chip makers (lower competition)

 Per Boa Merrill Lynch

* $85 price target
&gt;  *  We believe 4Q FY18 (August-end quarter) earnings should rise further vs 3Q on stable ASP (just marginal corrections). We assume a 9-11% decline in FY19-20 EPS after the FY18 peak, but management's presentations should imply a further increase. Thus the recently corrected spot price does not well represent Micron's non-spot business-related growth catalysts. We may revisit our earnings forecasts after the 3Q FY18 results call.

**Further upside in FCF due to EBITDA expanding much higher than capex; cash holdings exceed debt for first time**

https://i.imgur.com/t0lgMp5.png

On the recent price drop:

&gt; Micron’s share price declined 8% on 31 May. Since **we do not see any new negative
developments**, the correction was likely due to another broker’s downgrade call on
valuation/growth concerns (as the media reported). However, we **maintain our Buy rating
and US$85 PO**. Our view is mainly based on a favorable competitive landscape – Korean
chipmakers’ limited DRAM supply growth (tight to meet demand). Meanwhile, Samsung’s
new 1ynm node contribution to DRAM production is still small, and will likely be so even
in 4Q18 (below 10%; mostly 1xnm). Hynix’s most advanced tech, 1xnm (not yet 1ynm),
won’t be mainstream in 2H (mostly, still year-ago old 20nm). As Samsung and Hynix
supply about 75% of global DRAM, their low bit growth or slow migration to next
generation node should offer ASP/margin upside (for Micron). We estimate DRAM will
account for 70%/85% of Micron’s FY18-20 sales/OP, respectively (rest mostly NAND).
Micron’s recently announced share buyback (US$10bn using 50% of FCF; similar to
Samsung) and well-deployed new tech also confirm its catalyst/competitiveness.
Further, our takeaways from Micron’s Analyst Day (21 May) suggest upbeat margin (50%
OPM, currently). The stock trades at 6x P/E and 1.6x P/B on FY18-20E.",False,False,1.0,1527867343.0,1527436599.8321111,-430743.1678888798

Me: Now that the ""void if removed"" have been deemed illegal, if I attempt the repair myself and it doesn't work, I can still send the product in for warranty?

Me: ""void if removed"" stickers that is

HTC: 3:49 PM Yes, that's correct. The warranty will be voided.

Me: The Federal Trade Commission put six companies on notice in early April for illegally telling customers that getting third\-party repairs voids the warranty on their electronics.

Me: You are saying HTC will illegally void my warranty?

HTC: 3:51 PM If you attempt to repair the controller and the sticker was removed then the warranty will be automatically void.

EDIT: I have only had my Vive 2 months and my controller already did this. The rep gave no indication I wouldn't go through this again in 2 months. With a possible 8 week return time, I would be without my product 50&amp;#37; of the time I've owned it so far. 2 months after that maybe I would have to go through it again.

Since having kids and the death of my last fur baby I never quite got behind the idea of having another. Well, here lately there's been a stray hanging around my house. I checked in with local shelters and animal control to see if she belonged to anyone or if anyone was missing her and so far nothing.


Finally after about a month of this cat steadily gaining a bit of a belly (otherwise pretty skinny cat) I took her to the vet.
No chip. Pretty malnourished and not healthy. And pregnant. So I went ahead and decided to keep her. I got extensive instructions to the vet who I'm scheduling weekly check ups with to make sure little momma gets good prenatal kitty care and the vet hooked me up with a local no-kill shelter who are going to help me adopt out the babies once they are born and weaned.


I named little momma 'Butters' and she'll stay with me even after the babies are adopted out. Our basement is finished so we installed a cat door and set up her stuff in there with a nice little ac unit for the summer and hubby is building her shelves to scale the walls and stuff when she's feeling better. I'm sewing her a big 'ol bed and making a wall quilt for her.


We were cuddling earlier and I realized her and I are both pregnant. I told her that no matter what she'll be well looked after. The older kids know to help feed her and look after her and hubs already loves her to pieces.

8nncm7,jasonlong1212,Has it been a whole year? Yep. (or: an early retirement update),financialindependence,381474,802,802,0,210,0,"**\*\*BACKGROUND\*\***

**\*\*Introduction\*\***: This post is the final monthly update in an early\-retirement series. I will be posting twice yearly: once around June 6 \(retirement anniversary\) and once around January 1 \(end of year finances\). As these posts have become increasingly popular based on the number of views and comments, and as my desire to spend nearly an entire day on reddit has significantly waned, my responses might be limited. Please check comments and posts from previous posts to find answers to potential questions. I genuinely appreciate all of the positive comments, even though I no longer take the time to say so individually.

**\*\*Model\*\***: I wish to maintain a portfolio that began in June 2017 at $1,025,772. My max goal withdrawal rate is 3&amp;#37; of each year’s starting balance, provided that the portfolio remains above $1M. Should the portfolio drop below $1M, I will lock back into a maximum $2500 per month \($30k per year\) guardrail withdrawal until the market recovers. I realize that this is not the holy Trinity method, but consider these three factors that give us flexibility: a 3&amp;#37; withdrawal rate is below the 100&amp;#37; historically safe mark of 3.2&amp;#37; for fifty\-year portfolio survival, the extended bull market peaked us nearly 20&amp;#37; above the original target amount \(meaning that $30k annually is actually 2.5&amp;#37; instead of 3&amp;#37; if restarting from the peak\); and our actual withdrawal rate was averaging less than 2&amp;#37; of the original portfolio balance \(due to earning additional income\) when we received an unexpected $30k windfall \(meaning that our current withdrawal rate is actually negative\). The budgeted withdrawal amount is $2773 per month for 2018. In 2017, it was $2564 \($2618 adjusted for inflation\).

**\*\*Career\*\***: I am a former retail pharmacist who hated his profession for the following reasons: unacceptable amounts of stress, lack of civility from the general public, capitalism gone amok, fundamental disagreement with the overuse of pharmacotherapy as an answer for underlying health issues, and a severe opiate crisis that few have yet to appreciate. I attended college for eight years to earn a bachelors \(1997\-2001\) and a doctorate \(2001\-2005\) before joining the workforce for nearly twelve years \(2005\-2017, entirely with CVS\). $150k in education costs were covered by academic scholarships \($25k\), employment during college \($20k\), prior savings from high school employment \($5k\), revenue from an eBay business while in college \($10k\), and massive help from my parents \($90k\). My salary plus compensation went from $115k in 2005 to $150k in 2017. My savings rate was about 70&amp;#37;.

**\*\*Finances\*\***: I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95&amp;#37; of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation goal is approximately 60&amp;#37; VTSAX \(total US stock market\) / 20&amp;#37; VFWAX \(total INTL stock market\) / 20&amp;#37; VWLUX \(US municipal bonds\). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon supplemental income \(future employment?\), social security \($10k/yr?\), inheritance \($500k?\), house equity \(no heirs?\), universal health care \(probable?\), or universal basic income \(possible?\). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes.

**\*\*FINAL MONTHLY UPDATE\*\***

**\*\*Spending\*\***: Living expenses for the month came to $1999. This is $774 under the 2018 monthly targeted amount of $2773. Our spending is 27.9&amp;#37; under budget for the month, 8.1&amp;#37; over for the year, and 14.9&amp;#37; over since retirement. We generated $1039 of income this month from my wife wanting to work and some of my old book royalties. Our investment withdrawal was $960 this month, thus our pro\-rated, annually\-adjusted withdrawal rate is 1.04&amp;#37; for the month, \-5.16&amp;#37; for the year, and \-0.76&amp;#37; since retirement. Without the additional income stream, our pro\-rated, annually\-adjusted withdrawal rate would have been 2.16&amp;#37; for the month, 3.24&amp;#37; for the year, and 3.45&amp;#37; since retirement.

**\*\*Investments\*\***: The portfolio went from $1,130,151 to $1,147,124 \(a 1.50&amp;#37; increase for the month\), which went down to a new total of \(drum\-roll\) $1,146,164 after cashing the checks and paying the bills. This is a 11.73&amp;#37; increase from the original starting balance of $1,025,772. Since retirement, capital income from the investment portfolio has produced the equivalent of a full\-time employee generating $53.14/hr of labor income. To sustain the original portfolio balance, $17.59/hr is the pace needed for COL based on spending rate; $\-4.75/hr is the pace needed for COL based on withdrawal rate. Dividends included, VTSAX \(61&amp;#37; AA\) went up 2.72&amp;#37; this month \(2.45&amp;#37; up for 2018\); VFWAX \(20&amp;#37; AA\) went down 1.18&amp;#37; \(1.39&amp;#37; down for 2018\); VWLUX \(19&amp;#37; AA\) went up 1.17&amp;#37; \(down 0.52&amp;#37; for 2018\).

**\*\*Reflections\*\***: This was our lowest spending month thus far. No significant purchases or expenses to speak of. The market recouped some of its losses from its February jitters. I had considered increasing my international exposure but am currently glad that I refrained.

**\*\*Experiences\*\***: I won the very non\-prestigious Strolling Jim Marathon on May 5 by twenty\-three minutes. I pre\-paid for this one as a backup before I won the state championship in April. I didn’t want to show up. I didn’t even plan on finishing the entire course to be honest, but I made a deal with myself to just treat it like a moderate effort training run. I was nowhere near 100&amp;#37;, but I broke the course record by ten minutes. I watched many more movies \(about forty, mostly silent\). I got lucky and bowled consecutive 170s on my first day back in eighteen months. I baked for the first time in my life \(gingerbread cookies\). I read a few books. I kayaked for the first time this year. I have averaged 63 minutes per day of physical activity over the past six weeks \(running/swimming/cycling/weighlifting\) with at least thirty minutes every single day. Running in the heat sucks.

**\*\*Upcoming\*\***: My time at the museum has run its course. I no longer find it stimulating. I plan to spend time volunteering as a running coach in some local clubs and as a pacer in some local races. I’d like to maintain my current lifestyle of more reading, kayaking, bowling, running, cycling, swimming, and watching classic films. I will try my best to do whatever the fuck I want.

**\*\*YEAR ONE\*\***

**\*\*Portfolio\*\***: Again, the portfolio went from $1,025,772 to $1,146,164 \(an 11.73&amp;#37; increase\) after expenses. Living expenses for the year came to $36,582. This is $4768 \(14.9&amp;#37;\) over the first year targeted amount of $31,814. We generated $46,452 of income from my wife wanting to work, my old book royalties, an unexpected tax refund, and an unexpected inheritance. Our investment withdrawal was \-$9870 this year \(a $9870 deposit\), thus our withdrawal rate was –0.76&amp;#37;. Without the additional income stream, our withdrawal rate would have been 3.45&amp;#37;. Without the tax refund, inheritance, small splurge as a direct result of the inheritance, and the delayed construction of the cabin \(a measure that I consider the best indicator going forward\), our withdrawal rate would have been 2.1&amp;#37; \(3.5&amp;#37; with no supplemental income under this same scenario. In short, I have finally arrived at the conclusion that our COL creates an effective withdrawal rate of 2&amp;#37;, but it would be 3.5&amp;#37; without additional income.

**\*\*Accomplishments\*\***: I consider these the highlights of my first year away from work: broke three hours in a marathon, broke three hours in a marathon for a second time \(including a course record and state championship victory\), won a second marathon by setting another course record, set a personal record in the half marathon, set a personal record in the 1500m swim, built a cabin, saw a total solar eclipse, took a two week driving vacation, read the three longest books of my life, got around to watching every movie we own, got around to playing every video game we own, got around to listening to every album we own, wrote in my daily journal every single day without exception, tackled all of my CE requirements, became a volunteer tour guide and paleontologist assistant at the natural history museum, created an astronomy timeline exhibit for the museum, made plans to become a volunteer running coach, watched Game of Thrones, re\-watched Parks and Recreation, painted for the first time, played a round of golf for the first time, grilled out for the first time, held a drunken scumbag at gunpoint for the first time, kayaked for the first time, went metal detecting for the first time, mastered the Rubik’s cube, mapped our property in detail, planted trees, fixed the driveway, made a creek in our woods, picked up a lot of litter, finished Final Fantasy XV, made monthly reddit posts on FI, and completed a 100\-point gratuity list.

**\*\*Greater Amount\*\***: What have I done more of since leaving work? Running \(about 1500 miles\), swimming \(now twice weekly\), weightlifting \(now twice weekly\), volunteering \(almost weekly\), hiking \(several treks\),  watching movies, solving puzzles, visiting my parents, spending time with my wife, housework, yardwork, cooking, video gaming, reading, studying astronomy, studying paleontology, napping, and doing whatever the fuck I want.

**\*\*Same Amount\*\***: What have I done about the same amount of since leaving work? Cycling \(kept focus on running\), bowling \(to favor a running injury\), visiting friends \(who are no less busy\), listening to SACDs \(distracted by internet\), and watching television \(trying to avoid too much\).

**\*\*Little Progress\*\***: What have I failed to do much of since leaving work? Learning to play an instrument \(lack of talent\), target shooting \(lack of interest\), improving my Spanish and Japanese \(got lazy\), being able to bench press my body weight \(tough hill to climb\), helping fight the opiate epidemic \(burned out\), going to yard sales \(lost interest\), reducing internet time \(too much political interest\), writing a sci\-fi novel \(still in planning stages\), deconverting religious adherents \(taking a break\), stargazing \(often monotonous\), cleaning up our woods \(needs it\), studying cartography \(due to astronomy/paleontology\), painting \(only twice\), kayaking \(only twice\), metal detecting \(only twice\), and camping \(only once\).

8nrzk1,COMPUTER1313,White House officials are making plans to order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal and nuclear plants in an effort to extend their life,investing,527895,63,63,0,65,0,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-01/trump-said-to-grant-lifeline-to-money-losing-coal-power-plants-jhv94ghl

&gt; The Energy Department would exercise emergency authority under a pair of federal laws to direct the operators to purchase electricity or electric generation capacity from at-risk facilities, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The agency also is making plans to establish a ""Strategic Electric Generation Reserve"" with the aim of promoting the national defense and maximizing domestic energy supplies.

&gt; ""Too many of these fuel-secure plants have retired prematurely and many more have recently announced retirement,"" only to be replaced by less-secure, less-resilient natural gas and renewable power sources, the memo said.

&gt; Trump administration officials have contemplated action for more than a year. After the Energy Department conducted a reliability study last year, Energy Secretary Rick Perry proposed a rule that would have compensated coal and nuclear plants for their ability to store months’ worth of fuel on site. Federal regulators shot down the idea in January.

&gt; That didn’t quell requests for help. A FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary requested immediate intervention from Perry’s agency in late March. That plea followed the Akron, Ohio-based company’s announcement to shut three nuclear power plants that feed the grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, the largest in the country. FirstEnergy Solutions filed for bankruptcy within days of its emergency request.

&gt; Invoking national security concerns could bolster the Trump administration’s case in any legal challenges over the intervention, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University.

&gt; ""It’s going to be tough to get a court to question DOE’s factual finding -- particularly if it relates to national defense,"" Peskoe said in an interview. Tapping two statutes simultaneously also could give the administration more ""legal room,"" Peskoe said.

&gt; The government last invoked the Defense Production Act to address the California energy crisis in early 2001, ordering natural gas sellers to prioritize contracts to sell supplies to utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Disclaimer: I own $PEGI and $NEP shares.

NEE's electricity generation portfolio consists of roughly half from natural gas, about a quarter from nuclear, about a quarter from wind, and single digit percentages from solar, coal and others. Back in 2017, coal was about 2% of their portfolio, but they recently shut down a major coal fired plant and replaced it with more natural gas and solar. I'd also expect their solar portfolio to rapidly grow as they had convinced a Chinese solar panel manufacturer to setup a plant in Florida by promising to buy GWs of solar panels.

I don't remember exactly what NEP's electricity generation portfolio consists of, but it's likely somewhat similar to NEE.

PEGI is self explanatory.

First Energy's portfolio consists of about 50% from coal and 25% from nuclear.",False,False,6.0,1527860707.0,1527436599.8321111,-424107.1678888798

Because of the distance between where the convention is and where my in laws live, they booked 4nights (Thursday night - Sunday night), making it a grand total of $555 or just under $140 a night for the hotel alone!

Can you imagine dropping this kinda cash and it’s **NOT** even a vacation?!?!

Of course my in laws could have driven home Sunday after the convention to save money...but it still would be $415 ***just*** for the hotel stay. This doesn’t include gas, food, and of course new clothes and accessories to strut around in at the convention.

The events of the past week have turned the subreddit into a [dumpster fire](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BeneficialEquatorialAfricangroundhornbill-size_restricted.gif) of spoilers, and while I live for the chaos, not everyone is a fan.

Obviously some spoilers will continue to slip through the cracks and I can't [control](https://media.giphy.com/media/1CI6d3LbdKOFa/giphy.gif) when you have a moment of weakness and think, ""Well, *maybe* it's okay if I read the comments..."" on any other site, but if you want to try to minimize the amount of spoilers you're exposed to in this subreddit, here are a few steps you can take. 

(Do you like how I channeled Reality Steve there by taking forever to get to the point? Speaking of, download Adblock Plus, people! No one should have to willingly exist in Steve's AltaVista nightmare.)

**Desktop users: Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)**

If you use **desktop**, download the **Reddit Enhancement Suite** plugin for your browser (this is the most effective option for avoiding spoilers).

**If you use NEW Reddit for desktop**, you’ll have to switch back to using Old Reddit until the RES team implements the filter feature into the redesign. You can do this by visiting old.reddit.com or go into your Reddit preferences and uncheck the box at the very bottom that says “Use the redesign as my default experience.”

&gt;*(Or something like that. I don’t have an Android phone, so someone who does can feel free to weigh-in or elaborate.)*

&gt;I don't think you can. Because Reddit hates you more than [Jordan hates sockless feet.](https://media.giphy.com/media/5BUFKKi4rjsKEzuKUu/giphy.gif)

Hopefully that's somewhat helpful for those of you looking to avoid spoilers this season, and to **everyone that is spoiled**, make sure you're correctly spoiler-tagging any post titles or comments you make so that these filters work for our unspoiled friends.

The 'evidence' behind this all is screenshots of our discord where our general users reported receiving the fake chaos orders which generated discussion of us doing the same with respect to fake orders. Our mods jumped into the discussion and the idea was briefly entertained. Let me reiterate that this was AFTER the original fake orders were sent. Here is the breakdown of what happened in our discord to be as transparent as possible.


[2:54 PM Eastern](https://imgur.com/zLlSKrB): Our user informs us of the fake chaos orders he received

[3:19 PM Eastern](https://imgur.com/TwYiKsY): Our general users bring up the idea of fake orders after the above generated discussion

[3:21 PM Eastern](https://imgur.com/DO5soB0): One of our mods responds to the idea of fake orders stating that if we were to do fake orders we'd ""have to find another way"" because the original chaos bot was already banned. This indicates that the site wide blacklist of the game had already occurred. 

[3:22 PM Eastern](https://imgur.com/vBDkP18): More of our general members suggesting a different idea to send fake orders to enemies that attempt to visit our order website. One of our mods responded to this idea stating that we have entertained the idea of giving enemies fake orders to OUR strategies. Once again this all just shows that these conversations were all hypothetical and our users were just spit-balling ideas. At no point in time was there a statement of ""Let's make fake orders"" and a mod said ""Yeah! That's a great idea. Let's do that ASAP""

[3:26 PM Eastern](https://imgur.com/yb7gntV): Me discussing with the Blue Alliance about how shitty I thought the fake chaos orders were.

The last bit of evidence that we are lacking is the timestamp of when all of the fake orders were sent to red teams. If they were sent before any of the above discussion in our discord then we believe that would be rather compelling evidence to completely clear our name. Unfortunately, we don't have that information, but if anyone else does please feel free to share. Also if the mods of /r/cfbrisk could share the time that the blacklist occurred it would help to clarify the situation.


**What we do know**

We don't want to point fingers here and play the blame game. I'm just going to share some information that we are aware of that may help shed light on this fake orders situation.

/u/jimjip is an alt account that that created a chaos subreddit (/r/cfbrisk_chaos) four days ago to mass PM users chaos orders. If you remember back to four days ago, that was when Chaos was completely trapped in Florida and on the brink of potential elimination. Michigan would clearly have no motive to increase Chaos participation and hurt our largest ally. 

We were aware of /u/jimjip a few days ago and the first few comments on the account were on /r/cfb and were very obviously made to seem like a Michigan fan. Those comments are now conveniently deleted. We don't know if the owner of the account made those comments to frame Michigan or if it was originally intended to be a mole account.

Here is a screenshot of the [orders](https://imgur.com/s7bgHzS) /u/jimjip sent in case the comments get deleted. Note that these comments have the same exact format as /u/testrail who created daily posts sending out orders for Ohio State. His orders can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/kxRkWNY) just in case they get deleted. Obviously it wouldn't be hard to generate a bot to mimic orders of other teams. But I would urge you to think what motivation Michigan would have to create fake chaos orders four days ago to increase Chaos participation when our largest ally had Chaos on the ropes? From our perspective, that seems like something a red team would have motivation for, right?

**Summary:**

So on one hand there is evidence of our discord discussing the idea of fake orders after one of our users received a fake order himself and seemingly after the site wide blacklist occurred.

On the other hand there is definitive proof that an account was made 3 days ago to increase chaos participation when chaos was trapped in Florida and on the brink of elimination. Furthermore, those chaos orders were in the format of OSU's PM's by /u/testrail. Meanwhile, the [orders](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444518362614202370/451827465938272270/image.png) from yesterday were in the format of Nebraska's PMs. 

Obviously Michigan could've manipulated the PM's to mimic OSU and Nebraska. The format of the orders isn't close to proof of anything. But, as I mentioned above, it doesn't make sense for Michigan to generate orders 4 days ago to increase chaos participation against Florida. Nor does it make sense to generate orders for chaos to attack ""Alabama Territory"" yesterday when those Alabama territories was Texas' best bet of escaping the reds and making it back to the Blue's front lines. 

**Disclaimer**:

I did not make this post to point fingers or start a shitting match of who did what. I'm not blaming the mods of Nebraska or OSU for generating these orders. I wanted to state the facts of what happened from the Michigan perspective to be as transparent as possible in an attempt to clear up our name.",False,False,,1527874081.0,1527436599.8321111,-437481.1678888798

Found a few really new ones this week - but how did they hold up? Let's dive in :)


Do you disagree about my opinions on these games? Let's have a friendly discussion below.


New to these posts? Check out the first one from 58 weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/66w44i/5_quick_tldr_android_game_reviews_recommendations/).  

The games games are ""ranked"" somewhat subjectively from best to worst, so take the ranking for what it is.



##**To the games!**
######**Onmyoji Arena** [Game Size: 1.62 GB] (free)

**Genre**: MOBA / PVP - Online

**tl;dr review**:

Onmyoji Arena is a visually stunning (seriously, just look at the 3D models!) 3 lane 5v5 MOBA with NO p2w Arcane/Rune system. Yes, finally! 

Instead, the game monetizes purely through selling characters (which can of course also be acquired for in-game gold, as in any other moba), and skins. 

To add a strategic element to the game, instead of runes, we have ""Abilities"", which are not upgradeable, but can be mixed to create unique character (want to surprise the opponent by going all in on phy. defense on an otherwise weak-armored DPS character? We can do that! :p). 

Easily the best MOBA I've played because of the fair gameplay and smooth gameplay.

######**MMA Manager** [Game Size: 200 MB] (free)

**Genre**: Sports - Online

**tl;dr review**: 

MMA Manager is essentially Crash Arena Turbo Stars for the sports fighting game genre. We hire a team of MMA Fighters, train them to become stronger and better, and then take on campaign or PVP fights that unfold automatically (like in C.A.T.S). We upgrade our gym, add new training facilities, and then rinse and repeat.

The interesting part is figuring out how to configure each fighter so that he/she best counters the opponent. Should you go all in on aggressive shoulder attacks, or take a defensive stance and going for high kicks? The strategic element is rather deep, which means that although there's a bit of a learning curve, it's a game you can actually become really good at.

Monetization happens through speeding up training, but iAP are disabled during beta.

######**Dustoff Heli Rescue 2** [Total Game Size: 229 MB] (free)

**Genre**: Arcade - Offline

**tl;dr review**:

We take off in a rescue helicopter, shooting enemy vehicles and buildings in a quest to save our allies, who are held hostage, and return them safely to our base. 

That's the basic concept of 2D arcade game Dustoff Heli Rescue 2, and I really enjoyed playing through its 30 missions (not done yet).

The main frustration is the energy system, which limits us to 10 plays before having to wait or pay.

######**Air Combat Pilot 2: WW2 Pacific** [Total Game Size: 229 MB] (free)

**Genre**: Flying / Action - Online

**tl;dr review**:

With 40 singleplayer missions, Air Combat Pilot is a visually great-looking WW2 themed flying game that isn't exactly a dogfighter, but rather focuses on completing objectives, such as destroying air balloons or ground targets, such as ships. 

The game is a lot of fun, but half of all planes can only be unlocked through premium currency, and the other half requires so much in-game currency that we have to grind quite a bit to buy them. Additionally, unless we buy a $3 iAP, ads will appear every once in a while, which means the monetization is rather heavy for a free to play title. 

Most controllers should work with the game, although the there are also both gyroscope and joystick controls, which also work just fine. A neat air combat game overall!

######**Talion** [Total Game Size: 3.33 GB] (free)

**Genre**: MMORPG / RPG - Online

**tl;dr review**:

Talion is a new open-world MMORPG from Gamevil in beta until June 5th, and it's simultaneously the most gorgeous-looking and automated game I've ever played.

Although the 3 available classes are gender-locked, the character creation screen allows for an insane amount of customization, but once we enter the game, EVERYTHING is automated. We run, fight, use skills, and start quests automatically, only tapping every now and then to complete a quest. 

Although some dungeons can be completed on auto too, the other dungeons and the 5 vs 5, 20 vs 20, and 50 vs 50 grand-scale PVP modes are the games main appeal right now, but most are time-locked and I haven't been able to catch any of them yet (I expect they'll be more easily available for all time-zones after beta).

Since accounts are wiped after the beta, there's no monetization enabled yet, so it's impossible to say how p2w the game will become. I expect monetization to focus on xp increase and other scrolls and cosmetics.

8nrshr,TheSocialUpgrader,You're Probably Hiding Some of Your Best Conversational Material,socialskills,414418,63,63,0,4,0,"For seventeen years, I’ve studied the best conversationalists and what they do differently.

One of the habits I discovered was that the best conversationalists don’t hide their flaws and imperfections—they embrace them. They are the first to admit their weaknesses. The path to social confidence and more interesting conversations starts with social vulnerability.

Think about the person or people who make you feel comfortable. Likable and easy\-going people are usually comfortable in their own skin and have embraced their character flaws. They are okay being a little vulnerable. These likable people are the first to admit that they aren’t perfect and are happy to laugh at their personal quirks. They’re quick to admit funny mistakes or episodes of forgetfulness. They use their flaws to their advantage.

Think about that for a minute...

The best conversationalists realize that their weaknesses and insecurities can actually make some interesting conversation material. Not many people want to listen to a braggart rave about how well he did on a test or how many new sports cars he owns. But everyone enjoys hearing about the time you made a fool of yourself at that party—especially if you can laugh about it after the fact. Your flaws subconsciously make others feel better about themselves, as well. The end result is that people will often like you *more* after you expose an inner flaw or embarrassing experience, even of the small or trivial variety.

**Check out the following example:**

***Nate:*** *Wow, that’s an awesome tattoo.*

***Lisa:*** *Thanks, my husband George actually drew it.*

***Nate:*** *Really? That’s cool.*

Not a very interesting interaction, huh? Now let’s look at the conversation if Nate had admitted a weakness.

***Nate:*** *Really? I wish I could draw like that. I could probably draw a 3D cube, but that’s about it. My skills don’t get much beyond cubes—and half the time I even mess up the 3D part!*

The conversation took a much more interesting and playful turn because Nate admitted something he was bad at. These types of statements are also great to toss around in order to paint your self\-portrait with a little shade of humility. Look at a few more examples:

* *I never knew/experienced \_\_\_\_\_.*
* *I didn’t expect/think I’d find \_\_\_\_\_.*
* *I never knew there were \_\_\_\_\_.*
* *I was expecting \_\_\_\_\_, not \_\_\_\_\_.*
* *Trust me, you don't want me involved with \_\_\_\_\_.*
* *I'm the last person you want \_\_\_\_\_.*
* *I know absolutely nothing about \_\_\_\_\_.*

Think about your favorite comedian—there’s a good chance that he relies on a heavy dose of self\-deprecating humor. It’s one of the most common comedic techniques.

A few years ago, I was riding in a car with my new boss, and she asked me how to find our destination. I responded rather bluntly and with some embellishment, “I’ll be honest, I’m navigationally impaired…I’m probably the worst person to ask for directions. If I say turn ‘left,’ you’re probably better off turning right!” She quickly admitted that she, too, was horrible at navigating, and we both had a few laughs over who was worse! It was a good bonding experience.

When you leverage mistakes instead of fear them, mistakes can often lead to fun and engaging tangents rather than awkward moments.",False,False,6.0,1527858965.0,1527436599.8321111,-422365.1678888798

“I don’t really pay attention to rankings, because after I finish Dos Nachos I’m gonna move right back ahead of [Till]. But he landed the most significant hugs and the most significant love taps,” Covington said. “Does anybody want to see that?”

8nrv1n,Qu1bbz,It seems like people playing paper MTG/MTGO are used to an abusive economy and are more likely to accept it.,MagicArena,19769,82,82,0,114,0,"Dont get me wrong, almost every paper cardgame is rather expensive, but i feel like a lot of people are comparing the economy of MTGA with the economy of paper Magic or MTGO instead of its actual competition.

It's not a valid comparison. It's a digital cardgame and needs to compete with other digital cardgames. You are paying for a digital product which doesn't hold any value whatsoever, which is not the case for paper Magic or MTGO.

**Just because MTGA is cheaper than paper Magic or MTGO doesn't make its economy fair in any shape or form.** 

It seems like a lot of guys playing Magic in their past are more prone to spending money on the game, simply because they are used to spending a lot of money on Magic and therefore supporting the current economy. 

______________________________________________________________________________

**The goal is to attract new players** and actually growing the community instead of just dividing the current fanbase.

In its current state MTGA wont be able to compete and attract a lot of new players. ""Being the better game"" is a really stupid and myopic argument (and i can't believe they officialy said that).

It's highly subjective what defines a better game. I could argue that a lot of people would prefer hearthstone due to it's simplicity, short games, visuals and the warcraft universe itself.

**To be able to compete they need to be quite a bit more generous than established competition**, otherwise i can't see this game being successul besides milking their current fanbase even more.
Being more generous will attract more people which equals more profit long term, but it seems like they don't quite understand this.

______________________________________________________________________________

Who even knows how long this game will be supported, their past record isn't really promising and i'm kinda put off on spending money on a game that might lose its support in 3 years. 

This is quite concerning for me as a new potential player, since a lot of their **decisions seem be focused on cashing in the most amount of money short term**, rather than focusing on building up a great future with consistent and growing long term profit.

but it turns out this feature is far more clever than I realized, and it’s highly unlikely that your kids or jackass drinking buddies could ever trigger it. After the 5th failed attempt, iOS requires a 1-minute timeout before you can try again. During this timeout the only thing you can do is place an emergency call to 911. After the 6th attempt, you get a 5-minute timeout. After the 7th, 15 minutes. These timeouts escalate such that it would take over 3 hours to enter 10 incorrect passcodes.

So at the start of this year, I began my keto and intermittent fasting journey to help me become fitter, faster and most importantly, overcome unhealthy attitudes towards nutrition and food. 

I started at 220 lbs as seen in the first pictures \(no body shots, was very self\-conscious\) and after a full 5 months of strict keto diet with the once a day IF, I have managed to bring my weight down to 170lbs, the lightest I've been in a long time. 

My journey doesn't end here, and because of how great I feel and how much focus I have, I have no intentions of going back on to carb based diet, even after I hit my goal weight. 

Anyhow, everyone progress pictures were inspiring, so I'm going to post my own. Face gains much?

They are a few years old, a bit scrappy and only cost me like 10 bucks, but I like them.

Today I finally built up the courage to go into the shopping center and find a new pair. As I am walking along this 6 foot mixed chad lite employee came up and asked if I needed any help. I started to panic and accepted his offer and sat myself down and just said yes to the first pair he offered me.

He asked me what size I was and I said I had no idea (WTF) and so he started measuring my feet. I have really, really small feet and the second he removed my shoe he just looked at them puzzled and said ""wow these are pretty small... i'll chcek if there are any in that fit this in the back.."" 

People started to look and discuss among them and I went bright red which just made people start to snigger at me. It was so fucking embarrassing. As the chadlite was coming back with a box this 6'3 square jaw'd prince walked up to him and asked him to help him out.

The black guy literally put my shit down to go help this fucking lion of a man. He sits next to me (completely posture mogging me) and removes his shoes to try on a size he already knew would fit. I've never seen such perfect large feet in my life, perfectly complimenting his looks and size. 

In that moment, sat there next to this man who seemed another species with my tiny baby feet next to his I realized it was just fucking over for me. I said I had to go and walked out briskly and only realized a minute later I left my shoes there. 

I'm writing this from home with dirty feet and too ashamed to ever go to that place again, I don't know what the fuck I am going to do I have class tomorrow morning and no fucking shoes.

""Certeza? Tudo bem, cancelado.""

Foram muitas vezes essa belezura.

Três vezes no primeiro mês, e o atendente garantiu que estava cancelado.

Próximo mês, mais cinco ligações. A cobrança continuou, e todas as vezes dava algum problema - no dia seguinte falando que estava devendo, que não foi cancelado, etc.

Nesse último mês, a falta de honestidade se superou. Minha mãe - a quem o nome está ligada ao pacote - quase duas horas no telefone em cada ligação, clamava para ter certeza que foi cancelado. Foram três vezes garantindo que foi, e não tinha sido.

Falamos com a ""gerência"", que garantiu que seria cancelado e a cobranças dos meses passados terminariam.

No dia seguinte? Mensagem gravada falando que estavamos devendo quatro meses. Ligamos novamente e adivinha? Não tinha sido cancelado! A última chance foi dada, e a mulher ainda pefiu quatro números de telefone para ""contato"" (minha mãe, na extrema inocência, deu).

No dia seguinte, cada um dos quatro telefones receberam ligações privadas terroristas, falando que o nome da minha mãe estava no Serasa e que deveriamos depositar imediatamente na conta X (que pertencia à um nome totalmente genérico e aleatório). Provavelmente golpe dentro da empresa.

Ligamos lá, pacote ainda não cancelado! Totalizando 11 pedidos de cancelamento com os números. Ameaçamos entrar no Procom. A resposta? ""Não vai adiantar nada, não consta mais no sistema suas reclamações"".

Ligamos na Anatel, cinco dias depois tudo foi resolvido.

Me fala, como uma empresa dessas ainda está viva?",False,False,6.0,1527862881.0,1527436599.8321111,-426281.1678888798

&gt;He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘This is your final word?

&gt;‘It is,' said Dumbledore, also standing.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘Then we have nothing more to say to each other.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘No, nothing,' said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom ... I wish I could ...' 

Like i said, this is the moment where Dumbledore really realized that Tom Riddle could not be saved. And by his words, he blame himself.

Dumbledore couldn't find any way to connect with a young wizard with whom Albus clearly had much in common.  He’s saying that he wishes he could go back to that moment and be able to change things. Maybe he could be successful in providing the discipline and care that the young Tom needed. Likely he wishes that he could have been the “Hagrid” to Tom and that maybe Tom could have grown up into a better person.   Still, I don’t think his efforts would be successful.

8nrdqa,Rha3gar,Why Do We Dig The Graves?,nosleep,12296424,131,131,0,8,0,"My life changed the day I put a gun to my head. 

The years without my wife and son were unbearable. Time and hope seemed to pass by in tandem. With no family or friends, I grabbed two of my favorite possessions, a bottle of bourbon and my .45 caliber revolver. It was cold, rainy, and quiet— a good day to die. I took a final swig and placed the cold barrel against my sweating temple. With one final deep breath, I wrapped my finger around the trigger and…

*KNOCK—KNOCK—KNOCK* 

I set the gun down, racking my brain as to who could be at the door. I never had visitors. Still, I feared this person could hear the gunshot, and I didn’t want anyone to be involved with my death. I had already caused enough trauma for a lifetime. I got up from my bed and slowly stumbled to the front door. To my surprise, there was no one there. Instead a bouquet of thirteen black roses and a small brown parcel sat on my doorstep.

As I looked upon the ink-colored flowers, images of my wife’s funeral played in my drunken mind.

The memory of her memorial service is hazy, but there are a few details that I will never forget: the cold rain dampening my grey suit, the glaring stares of judgment from her family, the familiar sting of bourbon in the back of my throat, and the bouquet of black roses placed next to her casket. It was the first time I had ever seen black roses, and they stood out like a drop of dark paint on a white canvas. 

I looked down at the package again. A card placed within the black flowers asked one simple question written in red ink:

*Why do we dig the graves?*

To this day, I have no idea who left the ominous flowers and strange note.

Life as a single parent was difficult. My wife was the one who held our small family together. And then it was just my son and I… for a while. 

I would give anything to have my boy back. I should have been keeping an eye on him the day he went missing. As usual, I was too busy slipping out of consciousness, fumbling to take another drink before my heavy eyelids shut. The police never found him—and they probably never will. He was 7 years old when he was abducted.

I bent down and grabbed the items from my doorstep, brought them inside, and placed them on the table. After a few moments I tore open the rain-soaked parcel. Inside was a single spool of Super 8 film. Whoever sent me the package knew me well. Collecting Super 8 was my only hobby, although I rarely spoke of it.

With the film in one hand and my bourbon in the other, I retreated to the basement. I proceeded to dust off my old projector, hung a small sheet over a clothesline, and loaded the film. The image burst to life. A buzzing swarm of grey static was followed by a theatrical countdown: 

*3…2…1*

The black-and-white picture was shaky, displaying rapid flashes of clouds and sky. I inched closer to get a better view of the video. The scene came into focus—a boy in a large field, covered in dirt and grime. The camera zoomed closer, and his face came into the frame. The bottle fell from my hand and shattered on the floor. The boy… was my son, Benjamin—and he was digging large hole. 

I gasped. I was sure it was him. Thoughts raced through my head. I felt dizzy. 

Where was he? What was he doing? Who sent me the film? 

I kept watching, and in an instant, the basement exploded with sound, forcing me back in fright. 

A deep, grainy voice spoke: 

“Benjamin…” (My son stopped digging, cocked his head to the side, and stared at the camera.)

“Benjamin…why do we dig the graves?

“To bury the dead,” my son said in a monotone voice. 

“And why do we bury the dead?” the deep voice asked.  

Benjamin responded, “We bury the dead… to feed the black roses.”

I jumped to my feet and paced around the basement. I had to act. I had to rescue him. The voice spoke again: 

“Do not tell anyone. Come… alone.”

The camera panned to the large hole Benjamin had been digging, then focused on the surrounding area. 

It hit me. I knew the building he was standing near. It was the abandoned warehouse I used to pass on the way to work. It’s a monstrous eyesore in the middle of nowhere and has been falling into disrepair for half a century. I knew where to go…I knew where my son was.


I ran upstairs, nearly tripping on every stair. My mind continued to race as my nausea reached its peak. I sprinted to the bathroom and expelled the alcohol I had for breakfast. The factory…I had to go. I had to get my son back. 

I dressed as quickly as I could: grabbing my coat, forcing on my boots, and tucking the pistol in my waistband. 

I started my truck and hit the road. 

The drive was eerily quiet, as if the earth had stopped turning. Dark overcast flooded the world around me in a dreary atmosphere, void of light and warmth. Twenty minutes into my drive, I realized I had not seen another person, or even another vehicle. I was alone. 

This solitude continued throughout the entire trip. Eventually, the factory came into view. It’s dark, red brick cut through the horizon. I parked my truck and marched through the vast field of dirt towards the building—carefully avoiding the sporadic, rectangular graves scattered across the grounds.

Upon crossing the large, broken, iron-gated threshold, I crept towards the entrance of the abandoned factory. My footsteps making the only noise in an otherwise silent world.

The massive front door creaked open. I inhaled deeply and stepped inside. It was enormous—concrete walls and steel beams towered above me for miles. The floor was an endless sea of broken brick, metal, and dust. The skeleton of an old assembly line sat motionless in the center of the main room. I clicked on my flashlight and began my search, unsure of where to start. 

I walked the halls for what seemed like hours, frantically opening doors—only to find more dust and darkness. I was ready to give up. I decided I would head home, turn the film reel into the police, and drink this all away. I walked back to where I had entered the facility.  When I finally reached it, I stood in disbelief. 

The door was gone. It had been replaced by a solid concrete wall. I pushed against it with all my strength. 

How was this possible?

An explosion of noise and flashing light filled the entire factory. I spun around and drew the revolver from my waistband. The assembly line sprung to life with the loud grinding of gears.

I walked forward to investigate. Piles of twisted metal and glass traveled down the line and into the next room. An aroma filled the air, smelling of oil and gasoline.  I studied the contents, quickly discovering that they were automotive parts— horribly dented and broken. After a few moments the factory lights went out with a flash, and the assembly halted.  

I walked into the next room to see where the belt ended. I pushed open the double doors and walked inside. I pointed my flashlight towards a massive, dark object in the middle of the room. As soon as I saw what it was, I vomited. 

It was a car, my wife’s car. 

The memory of the night she died flooded my mind. I was drinking, always drinking. The sound of wind and snow whistled loudly outside. Benjamin was upstairs in his room, bedridden from a flu that had been going around his school. My wife had just gotten home from work, disgusted at the state I had drunken myself into. She sighed as she looked me up and down, “Well, since you clearly can’t drive, I guess *I’ll* go get some medicine for *our* son.” She slammed the door as she left. 

That’s the last thing I remember from that evening. 

The next morning, I was filling out paperwork at the police station. She died in the hospital a few hours after the crash. I was at home, unconscious during her final moments of life. I didn’t deserve her, and I never got the chance to say goodbye. 

I slowly approached the mangled remains of the sedan, shining my light through the broken windows. I crept towards the driver’s side window and peered inside. As my light illumined the inside of the vehicle, I fell back in horror. My eyes had to be lying. It wasn't possible. A human body sat in the seat, it’s forehead rest against the steering wheel. I stumbled backwards until my back met a cold, concrete wall. I slowly slumped down and buried my face into my hands. The dizziness and confusion returned. 

My thoughts began to race as I questioned the reality of the situation—overwhelmed with a familiar feeling of guilt. A guilt that I have felt every day since her accident. The guilt I try and drink away each day. I sat in the darkness, unsure of what to do or what to think. The room was spinning again, and the darkness washed over me as I turned off my light. I couldn’t stand to look at her car any longer. 

The silence of the room was broken by an unmistakable noise. A noise which I refused to believe was real.

The opening of a car door.

The hinges screeched loudly and echoed throughout the vacant factory floor. However, it was the sound that followed which left me paralyzed with fear. Wet, crackling footsteps on the stone floor approached me. I fumbled to pick up my flashlight. The room illuminated, and I gasped, 

“Noo….I… it can’t” was all that I was able to stutter. It was her… or what was left of her. The tattered remains of my wife’s corpse stood before me, staring down at me with one eye, the other, an empty socket dripping with blood. She was wearing the same clothes as the night of the wreck, torn and stained. 

I tried to speak again,
“Helen, I’m… sorr..I’m so sorry…” Warm tears ran down my face, and the flashlight shook violently in my quivering hand. 

The body shuffled forward, dragging a crushed foot and leaving behind a trail of dark blood. It knelt in front of me and placed a cold, skeletal hand against my cheek. The smell of rot was overwhelming. I closed my eyes tightly as I dry heaved from the putrid stench. I could feel its face a few inches from my own, my tears now an uncontrollable river. It pushed its cold, decaying face against mine and whispered broken words into my ear, 

*Why…do…we…dig…the…graves…?*

I screamed at the top of my lungs as I fired the .45. The sound was deafening. It reverberated through the cavernous building.  Seconds later, a deep silence overtook the building. 

I slowly opened my eyes...it was gone. All of it: the car, the corpse, everything. My heart was beating out of my chest as I tried to catch my breath. The smell of gasoline and rotten flesh still lingered in the air. Just as I began to calm myself, the factory lights flickered on, and the conveyer belt sprung to life once again.

I whipped my light rapidly around the room. Feelings of confusion and anger pulsed through my body. I looked towards the conveyer belt, as new objects began to appear. I crept forward to get a better look. 

They were toys… Benjamin’s toys.

I recognized them immediately. The Teddy bear I bought him for his second birthday, his first bicycle, toy trucks, games, and action figures. They rode along the conveyer belt, evenly spaced a couple feet apart. The toys on the belt fed into the next room. My fear and confusion had subsided and were replaced with burning rage. Who was doing this? Who was torturing me? 

My questions were answered as I kicked open the door of the next room. 

Standing in the middle of the floor was my son. It had been years since I had seen him. Behind him stood a figure much taller than me and dressed in a dark, hooded cloak. Its face was completely shadowed. Two frail hands were outstretched and resting on Benjamin’s shoulders. 

“Let him go. Now!” I spat as I pulled back the hammer of the revolver. 

They both remained still and unwavering. 

“NOW!” I screamed as I fired a round into the ceiling. 

“Father,” Benjamin said. 

“Ben…I … please come with me. We have to get you home,” I cried. 

He spoke again. “Each day father, with every drink... you dig the grave a little deeper.”

And before my eyes, his body withered away. In its wake, hundreds of black rose petals slowly fell to the ground, forming a large pile on the floor.

The hooded figure remained. 

“What did you do!? Bring him back!” I cried.

The figure slowly pulled back his hood, and I looked in disbelief. A disfigured version of myself stood before me. His contorted face grinned as he raised a bottle of amber liquid to its mouth and took a drink. A horrible, in-human laugh escaped its mouth and filled the room. 

Without hesitation, I fired a bullet straight into the monstrosity’s head, and my world fell into silence. 
....

Bright lights and machine noises flooded my senses. I whipped my head around and frantically scanned the unfamiliar room. I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t respond. Even then, leather straps fastened my hands to a cold, steel bed—I was trapped.
A doctor in a white coat walked in and sat next to my bedside. He smiled as he explained how lucky I was. Lucky that a neighbor walking their dog happened to hear the gunshot and called an ambulance, lucky that I had just awoke from a month-long coma, and lucky that someone cared enough to send me flowers. 

I looked at the bedside table and gazed at a vase full of jet black roses—and for the first time in a decade, I didn’t feel like having a drink. ",False,False,6.0,1527855043.0,1527436599.8321111,-418443.1678888798

8nskjd,farandfaded,Update: Baby has an unknown heart defect and we're being sent 4 hours away for further testing,BabyBumps,69515,44,44,0,12,0,"Yesterday was one of the longest I've had in a while between the all day doctors appointments, managing my 9 month old white nothing to do in a hospital, and the 4 hour drive back home immediately after. I'm exhausted but happy to have some answers.

Baby Girl has what is called a Double Inlet Left Ventricle heart defect. Basically it means her ventricles have no wall between them so they function as one pump. Also her pulmonary artery is closed so her heart has found a way to basically allow blood to flow backwards through the ductus of her heart and allow blood to the lungs after birth. However without surgery after birth and a series of surgeries within the first three years of life she won't survive more than a few days. Currently the oldest patients with this kind of defects are 30-40 years old. They seem to do really well in childhood but start to decline in adulthood. But with medical advances who knows where we could be in 10-20 years. 

I'm having an amniocentesis done later this week to check for further genetic abnormalities. If any are present my husband wants to have the baby and put her in comfort care and let her pass. His reasoning is that having genetic factors limits options for things like transplants and he doesn't want to raise our daughter just to bury her later, which I completely understand.  I, however, want to allow her to complete the surgeries regardless. They have a 70-80% of survival and can allow her to live longer as new treatments are developed.

Either way I'll be delivering 4 hours away from where we currently live and be in the hospital for at least a month after. If the baby shows no genetic abnormalities my husband wants to move to the city that I'll deliver in. I honestly wouldn't mind as it would make our lives easier because our son already receives treatment there and it's 30 mins away from his family. I'm just dreading a second move while pregnant and leaving my entire family behind. 

I'm getting in contact with a parents group for children with this defect and am hoping to get some supper from there but I really appreciate you all listening to my ramblings. ",False,False,6.0,1527865695.0,1527436599.8321111,-429095.1678888798

**What is Reddit?**


Reddit is a source for what's new and popular on the web.

 
Users like you provide all of the content and decide, through voting, what's good and what's junk.

 
Links that receive community approval bubble up towards #1, so the front page is constantly in motion and (hopefully) filled with fresh, interesting links.

**REDIQUETTE** 


**PLEASE do:**


* **Remember the human.** When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself ""Would I say it to the person's face?"" or ""Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?""
* **Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.**
* **Read the rules of a community before making a submission.** /r/thebachelor rules can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/about/rules/)
* **Read the reddiquette.** Read it again every once in a while. Reddiquette is a living, breathing, working document which may change over time as the community faces new problems in its growth.
* **Moderate based on quality, not opinion.** Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.
* **Use proper grammar and spelling.**  Intelligent discourse requires a standard system of communication. Be open to gentle corrections.
* **Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free.** If it is an outrageous topic, share your crazy outrage in the comment section.
* **Look for the original source of content, and submit that.** Often, a blog will reference another blog, which references another, and so on with everyone displaying ads along the way. Dig through those references and submit a link to the creator, who actually deserves the traffic.
* **Post to the most appropriate community possible.** Also, consider cross posting if the contents fits more communities.
* **Vote.** If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.
* **Search for duplicates before posting.** Redundant posts add nothing new to previous conversations. That said, sometimes bad timing, a bad title, or just plain bad luck can cause an interesting story to fail to get noticed. Feel free to post something again if you feel that the earlier posting didn't get the attention it deserved and you think you can do better.
* **Link to the direct version of a media file** if the page it was found on isn't the creator's and doesn't add additional information or context.
* **Link to canonical and [persistent URLs](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html) where possible,** not temporary pages that might disappear. In particular, use the ""permalink"" for blog entries, not the blog's index page.
* **Consider posting constructive criticism/ an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.**
* **[Report](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com&amp;subject=Spam) any spam you find.**
* **Browse the [new submissions page](http://www.reddit.com/new/) and vote on it.** Regard it, perhaps, as a public service.
* **Actually read an article before you vote on it** (as opposed to just basing your vote on the title).
* **Posts containing explicit material such as nudity, horrible injury etc, add [NSFW](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_do_all_of_these_acronyms_mean.3F) (Not Safe For Work) for nudity, and tag**. However, if something IS safe for work, but has a risqué title, tag as SFW (Safe for Work). Additionally, use your best judgement when adding these tags, in order for everything to go swimmingly.
* **State your reason for any editing of posts.** Edited submissions are marked by an asterisk (*) at the end of the timestamp after three minutes. For example: a simple ""Edit: spelling"" will help explain. This avoids confusion when a post is edited after a conversation breaks off from it. If you have another thing to add to your original comment, say ""Edit: And I also think..."" or something along those lines.
* **Use an ""Innocent until proven guilty"" mentality.** Unless there is obvious proof that a submission is fake, or is whoring karma, please don't say it is. It ruins the experience for not only you, but the millions of people that browse reddit every day.
* **Read over your submission for mistakes before submitting, especially the title of the submission.** Comments and the content of self posts can be edited after being submitted, however, the title of a post can't be. Make sure the facts you provide are accurate to avoid any confusion down the line.


**PLEASE Don’t:**


* **Engage in illegal activity.**
* **Post someone's personal information, or post links to personal information.** This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible. We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism [hurt innocent people too often,](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d7m1c/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/) and such posts or comments will be removed. Users posting personal info are subject to an immediate account deletion. If you see a user posting personal info, [please contact the admins.]( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23reddit.com&amp;subject=posting%20of%20personal%20info) Additionally, on pages such as Facebook, where personal information is often displayed, please mask the personal information and personal photographs using a blur function, erase function, or simply block it out with color. When personal information is relevant to the post (i.e. comment wars) please use color blocking for the personal information to indicate whose comment is whose.
* **Repost deleted/removed information.** Remember that comment someone just deleted because it had personal information in it or was a picture of gore? Resist the urge to repost it. It doesn't matter what the content was. If it was deleted/removed, it should stay deleted/removed.
* **Be (intentionally) rude at all.** By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us.
* **Follow those who are [rabble rousing](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rabble) against another redditor without first investigating both sides of the issue that's being presented.** Those who are inciting this type of action often have malicious reasons behind their actions and are, more often than not, a troll. Remember, every time a redditor who's contributed large amounts of effort into assisting the growth of community as a whole is driven away, projects that would benefit the whole easily flounder.
* **Ask people to [Troll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29) others on reddit, in real life, or on other blogs/sites.** We aren't your personal army.
* **Conduct personal attacks on other commenters.** Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation.
* **Start a flame war.** Just report and ""walk away"". If you really feel you have to confront them, leave a polite message with a quote or link to the rules, and no more.
* **Insult others.** Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and encouraged.
* **Troll.** [Trolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29) does not contribute to the conversation.
* **Take moderation positions in a community where your profession, employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.**
**In regard to voting**
* **Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.
* **Mass downvote someone else's posts.** If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.
* **Moderate a story based on your opinion of its source.** Quality of content is more important than who created it.
* **Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.** Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.
* **Report posts just because you do not like them.** You should only be using the report button if the post breaks the subreddit rules.


**In regard to promoting reddit posts**

 
* **Hint at asking for votes.** (""Show me some love!"", ""Is this front page worthy?"", ""Vote This Up to Spread the Word!"", ""If this makes the front page, I'll adopt this stray cat and name it reddit"", ""If this reaches 500 points, I'll get a tattoo of the Reddit alien!"", ""Upvote if you do this!"", ""Why isn't this getting more attention?"", etc.)
* **Conduct polls using the title of your submission and/or votes.** These methods are not reliable because of [vote fuzzing](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eaqnf/pardon_me_but_5000_downvotes_wtf_is_worldnews_for/c16omup?context=3) and are in that regard just asking for upvotes.
* **Send out IMs, tweets, or any other message asking people to vote for your submission — or comply when other people ask you.** This will result in a ban from the admins. Your submission should get points for being good, not because the submitter is part of a voting clique.
* **Ask for upvotes in exchange for gifts or prizes.** ""Upvote me to the top and I'll give away ...""
* **Create mass downvote or upvote campaigns.** This includes attacking a user's profile history when they say something bad and participating in karma party threads.


**In regard to new submissions**

 
* **Use the word ""BREAKING"" or other time sensitive words in your submissions.** By the time your post reaches the front page, it probably won't be 'breaking' anymore.
* **Post hoaxes.** If snopes.com has already declared something false, you probably shouldn't be submitting it to reddit.
* **Flood reddit with a lot of stories in a short span of time.** By doing this you flood the new queue. Be warned, your future submissions may be automatically blocked by the spam filter. Shadow banning (you can see your posts and votes, but no one else can) can, and will, take place in more severe cases.
* **Write titles in ALL CAPS.**
* **Editorialize or sensationalize your submission title.**
* **[Linkjack](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=linkjack) stories:** linking to stories via blog posts that add nothing extra.
* **Use link shorteners to post your content.** There are few reasons to hide what you're linking to, and most of them are sneaky (if you are, use the ""preview"" feature that those services offer).


**In regard to comments**
 

* **Make comments that lack content.** Phrases such as ""this"", ""lol"", and ""I came here to say this"" are not witty, original, or funny, and do not add anything to the discussion.
* **Announce your vote [(with rare exceptions).](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hppgf/this_is_the_start_of_a_beautiful_friendship_reddit/c1xbyx6)** ""Upvote"" and ""Downvote"" aren't terribly interesting comments and only increase the noise to signal ratio.
* **Complain about other users reposting/rehosting stories, images, videos, or any other content.** Users should give credit where credit should be given, but if someone fails to do so, and is not causing harm, please either don't point it out, or point it out politely and leave it at that. They are only earning karma, which has little to no use at all.
* **Complain about the votes you do or do not receive, especially by making a submission voicing your complaint.** You may have just gotten unlucky. Try submitting later or seek out other communities to submit to. Millions of people use reddit; every story and comment gets at least a few up/downvotes. Some up/downvotes are by reddit to fuzz the votes [in order to confuse spammers and cheaters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eaqnf/pardon_me_but_5000_downvotes_wtf_is_worldnews_for/c16omup?context=3) This also includes messaging moderators or admins complaining about the votes you did or did not receive, except when you suspect you've been targeted by vote cheating by being massively up/downvoted.
* **Complain about reposts.** Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote. Keep in mind that linking to previous posts is not automatically a complaint; it is information.
* **Complain about cross posts.** Just because you saw it in one place, doesn't mean everyone has seen it. Just vote and move on.

So I’ve lived with a horrible roommate who hates my guts for over a year now. Usually I just stay in my room to avoid her because there’s not a confrontational bone in my body, but she still finds nice little ways to make life miserable. We’ll call her N.

N has always enjoyed fun roommate activities like not doing dishes for months at a time (I was blamed for every dish so I switched to disposable plates, haven’t used actual cutlery in months so it’s all her), smoking weed in the house almost every day, never paying bills on time then getting mad at us for “pestering her” about them, and getting mad at pretty much anything else we do.

Now for a little backstory, N has 2 huge German Shepherds who are loud, aggressive, and stay in the backyard almost every night while she’s out partying. Our neighbors have a young kid who is woken up by the loud barking, so we’ve had the cops called on us 4 times already for noise complaints from. I also have a dog (border collie) but she stays in my room for most of the day bc I’m only ever gone for a few hours at a time. The last time the cops were called I was home and the officer let it go with a warning but said next time there will be a ticket.

Fast forward 2 months, N is dog sitting for a friend (we now have 5 big dogs in our tiny house) and these dogs are even more barky, which only riles up her 2 even more. She’s left them outside for the past 2 night when she goes to bed and they sit outside my window howling their asses off until 3 am until I finally let them in out of fear for a ticket. Finally I’ve had enough, so I let the dogs in again and politely ask they be kept inside overnight bc we’re going to get a ticket... and she LOSES IT.

She fires back a two paragraph text about how it’s somehow my fault, that my dog barks 24 hours a day anyway (not true), that I need to immediately let them back outside and she isn’t worried about cops.

Ha, ok.

Like any good roommate would, I release the hellhounds into the backyard and they immediately go apeshit, then I grab my purse and book it out if there to stay w a friend for the night. Came back the next day and - surprise! - the neighbors called the cops and N received a BEAUTIFUL $350 citation. 

She’s pissed, it feels so good.

I hope she moves out.

TL;DR- Roommate’s dogs get the cops called for noise, she gets more dogs. Tried to warn her about ticket potential, doesn’t listen, I let them bark it up and get her a citation.",False,False,6.0,1527844711.0,1527436599.8321111,-408111.1678888798

But for real, start now.

I have been working on my weight loss for the past 6 months now. Just after I gave birth to my second child I weighed in at 201lbs. If you had asked me 6 months ago if I would still be going strong, be the skinniest I've ever been and have lost 50lbs total I would have been shocked. Like many of you I have lost weight before and gained it back +20. It can be so discouraging to know you tried in the past and ""failed"". Start again now. Start for the first time now. Just start. Don't look back and wish you started 6 months ago. Who knows where you'll be in 6 months if you start now. 

In 6 months I should be at my goal weight, possibly even have made it there already. That's whack. I can't fathom it. Even if I slip up and don't quite make it to my goal weight, I will still have success in the next 6 months.

For those that don't know what happened please look at my post history or the bottom of this post. My apologies for the trouble.

So the neighbors came over to my house angrily this morning and left a note. I had already gone to work by this time but my surveillance system notified me. The woman who came to the door (cat's guardian) was clearly rather profane and upset. After 10 minutes of waiting and muttering to herself she left a note which I had a friend drop by and pick up on his way to work. It read the following:

 ""We know you have been spraying out cat with water. If you do not stop we will make sure you are charged with multiple acts of animal cruelty. Why are you making such a big deal out of this situation? We have seen deer on your property and we don't see you making a big fuss then!!! You are needlessly being cruel to our cat by taking the actions you have. Our kids are very upset that you think you have the right to be cruel to our cat just because he is harmlessly wandering and doing his natural business on your property. Your land does not just belong to just you but the nature around you! You have no right to regulate what creature can or cannot come to  what you perceive is ""your property"". Do not think your cruelty will go unpunished??? You are a despicable person.""

I want to be very clear I have never tried to intentionally physically harm the cat. I installed sprinklers yesterday to deter the cat from going near my fountain and I'm guessing he caught on to this fact and the neighbors are not happy. I have zero knowledge for what constitutes animal cruelty or if I have done something wrong. Is there anyone here that can possibly give me some direction on what I may have done wrong. Are my neighbors just making this up to make me fearful for installing deterrents for their cat on my property? I would hate to get in trouble over what I perceive to be a rather tame and trivial issue. Thank you for your time.

I am not sure if this is appropriate to post here, if not my apologies. 

I live in CA and enjoy sitting outside after a long days work. My neighbors cat has been ruining this for me by pooping into my water fountain to such a point that I have to clean my water pump and water every couple days after the cat destroyed my last  two pumps. Besides that I cannot stand the terrible odor lingering outside from the cat doing his business. I have talked to my neighbor about it and she gives me some bs response that maybe I shouldn't have my water fountain where it is (on my property). Mind you this is a permanent water fountain structure made out of stone. I have tried a lot of things including concentrated citrus oil, coffee grounds, black pepper, and even predator piss (I am that desperate) to dissuade the cat from visiting my backyard, but nothing has worked. Also I should disclose that the cat is not fond of me and has attacked me unprovoked 5+ (also documented) , so needless to say the cat does not like me. I have surveillance and have archived all relevant footage. I am getting increasingly more frustrated, and I want this siege against me by the damn cat to stop. Is there anything I can do legally speaking? Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Update1 (05/31/2018): I have really appreciated all the advice that people have been suggesting and have plans on implementing a motion detector sprinkler based solution. Though I would like to think that this will fully resolve the issue, in the case it does not, could I have a hired attorney do something about my situation or would it be a waste of time (reimbursement for medical costs for cat attacks and pump repair and replacement costs)? Please note I have tried to deliver these official bills through certified mail twice to no avail.

Update2 (05/31/2018): I have since had motion detector sprinklers installed in my backyard precisely placed in line with my fountain (as suggested by a reddit user down below) . Should this not work I will resort to other methods suggested. I am very appreciative of all the people that took time out of their day to give me advice. I will keep this post updated just in case anyone is interested in followup.

I've had several people reach out to me regarding the fact that I was banned from the conspiracy subreddit. As some of you know, I was pretty active there, specifically regarding coordination between the Kremlin and the right-wing United States, specifically the Trump campiagn and the NRA. 

A little over a week ago, I was banned by /u/RecoveringGrace, citing ""spam"" and a Rule 13 violation. This was discussed on this subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8lmzq1/top_mod_of_rconspiracy_urecoveringgrace_engages/).

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/1Us00nB) is the modmail of my contesting of the ban. It's worth noting that the only mod to make any mention of the rule violations I was cited for said that they didn't see the violation, and that the mod who banned me has since had their account suspended by reddit. It's also not lost on me that most, if not all, of the mods who were chosen by the ""conspiracy conclave"". You can read the details for yourselves.

The post I linked in the screenshots regarding discussions of spam was talked about on this sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8gs6my/mastigia_proves_he_cannot_stand_for_opposing/).

So I'd like to address a couple things to you all, as I know there's been some interest regarding my plight, and I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.

- So why did I post on such an obviously problematic sub?

Well, it's pretty obvious to me that the ""free thinking"" community has been co-opted by right-wing forces. This is a bit of a side note, but I find this subject extremely interesting, personally (I had the book Kill All Normies recommended to be by someone on the conspiracy sub, and I highly recommend it, it talks a lot about how the alt-right was able to take the energy from things like Gamergate and turn it into pro-Trump support. [This](https://qz.com/901761/donald-trump-and-steve-bannon-are-using-gamergate-culture-to-attract-angry-white-men/) article is about the same subject, it's pretty interesting. 

But anyway, I was so active on the sub because I find the whole ""Russia thing"" extremely interesting, (although we're getting to a point that there's not a ton of new stuff coming out all the time, because a lot of it has been spelled out already), and I'm not really a fan of echo chambers. Sure, I could have been active on /r/RussiaLago or /r/politics but I liked the debate aspect of it. Plus, it's always interesting to see what arguments people have when they're really trying hard to avoid facts. It was fun to debunk silly theories that weren't grounded in reality. 

After a while, I realized that I had a reputation, that I had a lot of people who didn't like me because of my point of view, and it definitely encouraged me. If you're pissing a lot of misguided people off, gotta be doing something right!

- Are you going to fight your ban harder?

Nah. When I was most active on the sub, I was stuck at a job that was profit-motivated and soul-sucking, but afforded me a TON of free time to reddit. I don't really have that anymore. I also think that my being so active on reddit was making a small difference, maybe changing a few minds. For me, it was also giving me a sense of doing something that mattered when I was clocking in and out of something that really didn't. But I've switched jobs to a more altruistic field, and I see myself making a difference in people who need it most's lives. My ""real life"" requires a lot more focus than it did a few months ago, so I'm going to be focusing on real life and getting away from Reddit life.

- How do you think you lasted so long?

Pretty simple. I stuck to the rules and I stuck to them really hard. I found that people get even more annoyed with you if you stay calm, be polite to them, and don't give them any room to attack your character. Cite your sources, ask them to provide sources, try and keep debate intellectually honest. Stick to fact and logic based arguments and people who are arguing against facts and logic will melt down. Take personal insults as a compliment to the fact that you've proved yourself right. This will piss people off a lot, but it doesn't give them any room to take any action against you. I've known people had been looking for a good reason to ban me for a while. I wasn't going to give them one. Turns out they didn't need one.

- What about that emoji guy who followed you around all the time?

Dunno, he'll find a new crush, I assume.

I have a relative big discord with different type of people and nationalities, all with the same purpose of playing games together and having fun. On release date, me and 2 other friends bought Bless and played together. Yes, it was bad optimized, yes, it had long queues, yes, it had a lot of bugs and bad translations, but despite all of the flaws with the game, WE DID HAVE OUR FUN TOGETHER. Next day, one of the guys messages me as soon as X youtuber uploads a video and tells me exact this words: ""OMG DUDE! Have you seen X video about Bless, I mean, if X says it sucks, tbh, it does, so I am going to refund this sh!t game."". The other guy refunded because he watched the video too, and there I was left alone with my ""fun"". 

Why do you have to do something just because everyone else is doing it and most important what do you guys have against some people having fun on something YOU hate. Try and take others opinions with a grain of salt.

8nphgj,Obversa,"""J.K. Rowling vs. the Internet"" - A History of ""Harry Potter"" Online",harrypotter,431969,244,244,0,96,0,"This post started off by seeking to answer the following question:

&gt; *""Why is the Harry Potter fandom starting to turn against JK Rowling?""*

This is a question that has been especially asked as-of late in the online fan community, and I wanted to give my personal view and input, as a longtime Harry Potter fan myself.

Simply put, I think it is primarily because J.K. Rowling’s views, since first writing the series, have changed, especially after she has published the books.

Likewise, her attitude as to her “ownership”, and the future direction of, Harry Potter vastly differs from the views of many Harry Potter fans, especially those fans who express their opinions online.

Or, in a nutshell, I’ll title this answer **“J.K. Rowling vs. the Internet”**.

-------

**Introduction**

Times have vastly changed since J.K. Rowling first outlined, planned, and began writing the Harry Potter books in the 1990’s. 

While most of her readership were children born, and growing up, in the 1990’s and 2000’s, and with the Internet as an increasingly important staple of the modern Western household and culture, J.K. Rowling did not.

Instead, Rowling herself grew up as a member of Generation X (b. 1965), and as of the writing of this article, is 52 years old. Thus, she, and her views, fit more in-line with most Harry Potter fans’ parents, as opposed to the fans themselves.

Due to this, there also appears to be an ever-widening generational gap between Rowling herself, and the majority of younger Harry Potter fans, the latter of whom are largely a part of the Milennial Generation. Rowling, up until recently, has proven to be more conservative than many of her fans on certain views, particularly on copyright issues, expressing her “ownership” over Harry Potter, and “fan works”.

The most notable examples of this are, in chronological order...

------

**1995–1997 - The Internet begins to build global roots. The first Harry Potter book, ""Harry Potter and the Philospher’s Stone"", is released.**

While J.K. Rowling was penning Harry Potter, the Internet was still in its infancy. At first, due to this, Rowling, unable to afford a computer - much less Internet - wrote and did her outlines for the books on “napkins” and pieces of printer paper at a local establishment in her area, the Elephant House.

In 1995, only 0.4% of the world population, or 16 million users, had access to the the Internet; by the release of the first Harry Potter book in 1997, that number had risen to 1.7%, or 70 million users.

As not many people had the Internet, Harry Potter first gained fame through “word of mouth” among reading and educational circles by publishers Bloomsbury (UK) and Scholastic (US), and was first promoted, and would later be come to seen for years to come, as a “children’s book”.

-----

**1997 - 2004 - The Internet spreads rapidly on a global scale, ballooning from being used by 1.7% of the global population (70 million users) , to 12.7 % (~1 billion users).** By 2002, the first social media website, Friendster, also appears online, garnering 3 million users by 2003.

In 2003, both MySpace and LinkedIn launch online, beginning the rise of social media on the Internet. Online chat rooms are also popular.

Included in the spread of “Internet culture”, and during the adolescence of social media, is the founding of several Harry Potter online communities for fans, including websites like SugarQuill, MuggleNet, the Leaky Cauldron, the Harry Potter Lexicon, Fanfiction.net, and others.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter becomes increasingly popular in mainstream culture as more books and films are released, transforming from a mere “children’s book series” into a “pop culture phenomenon”. For books, ""Chamber of Secrets"" is released in 1998; ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", in 1999; ""Goblet of Fire"", in 2000; and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" in 2003.

As the Internet is increasingly integrated into Western schools, and J.K. Rowling conducting online “chat room interviews” with school-children, Harry Potter fan fiction and discussion begins to appear - and spread rapidly - online, quickly dwarfing other book communities.

By the present day, Harry Potter is by far the largest fandom with written and posted fanfictions on Fanfiction.net, numbering about ~787,000 works.

Likewise, “BNFs”, or Big-Name Fans, begin to appear in the Harry Potter online fan community, and greatly influence many fans’ views with their postings.

Some of these “BNFs”, particularly for the most popular Harry Potter fan websites, become publicly seen as the primary spokespeople for the online fan community, despite most being teenagers. They are also given opportunities to host exclusive interviews with J.K. Rowling herself, so long as they “supported Rowling’s views and vision”.

However, J.K. Rowling did *not* seem particularly fond of the Internet herself, or online communities. [In fact, the concept of the Internet itself “scared” her.](http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0302-newsround-mzimba.htm)

----------

**2004 - J.K. Rowling comes out publicly in support of Harry Potter fanfiction online, but only on “her terms”.**

As you might tell, to the then-young fan base at the time, this wouldn’t have been a problem. However, as the fan base “grew up”, and Internet use continued to spread globally, this *did* become an issue.

To quote Rowling's agent:

&gt; “J.K. Rowling's reaction is that she is very flattered by the fact there is such great interest in her Harry Potter series, and that people take the time to write their own stories. Her concern would be to make sure that it remains a non-commercial activity to ensure fans are not exploited, and it is not being published, in the strict sense of traditional print publishing.

&gt; The [Harry Potter] books may be getting older, but they are still aimed at young children. If young children were to stumble on Harry Potter in a an x-rated, ‘adult content’ story, that would be a problem [for J.K. Rowling].”

The rise of the Internet, especially as time went on, also continued to play an increasing role in the gap between Rowling’s views, and those of Harry Potter fans. As Internet use became more ingrained and a cornerstone in Western culture, so, too, did discussing Harry Potter by fans in online communities.

According to one article:

&gt; “[Fanfiction is] something that fan cultures have always been involved in. The arrival of [the Internet] means it has a greater visibility. Before the age of the Internet, it was only circulated between fans.”

--------------

**2005 - ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (book) is published.** 

After going on a “research trip” to an orphanage prior to the book’s release, presumably to write a believable and realistic backstory for Tom Marvolo Riddle (Lord Voldemort)’s childhood spent in one, the appalling conditions of the institutions cause Rowling’s views to begin to change.

Sometime between 2005 - 2007, [Rowling would go on to change her previous view, and stance, of Voldemort as a “psychopath”, developing more sympathy and empathy for his character than she had previously](https://www.quora.com/Was-Voldemort-a-psychopath-He-was-self-preserving-7-horcruxes-self-centred-He-killed-without-batting-an-eyelid-He-couldnt-love/answer/Amber-Goldsmith). Furthermore, her horror at the reality of orphanages’ terrible conditions caused her to found her primary charity, LUMOS, dedicating to “abolishing” these institutions, and reuniting children with their families.

This, I believe, marks the beginning of Rowling’s changing views on a story that she once promised to herself to “stick to her original outline on”. She had been writing the story for almost a decade (10 years) at this point.

It would also mark when she fist began to diverge from most fans’ popular views on the Harry Potter books and characters, which would, it seem, largely remain the same, even in the decade or so to come.

---------

**2007 - Rowling publishes ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", the books series’ final installment.**

Her making public her view of Dumbledore as gay after the book’s release was also seen as contentious, especially during, and after, a period in the United States where gay marriage, and LGBTQA+ rights, were a major issue (1990’s - 2000’s).

A lot of fans tend to forget that this reveal was 11 years ago, when the scene for LGBTQA+ rights, and how people viewed them, was much different than it is today. Popular perception of LGBTQA+ folk from the 1990’s, when Harry Potter is set, was still changing, and would for several years to come. Only 4 years earlier, in 2004, the first legal same-sex marriage in the United States had taken place in Massachusetts.

However, even in the given climate at the time, Rowling’s announcement was met with plenty of controversy - and some because gay marriage was not yet legal in the United States. Likewise, there were some rumours of Warner Brothers, the makers of the Harry Potter films, quietly “silencing” their LGBTQA+ actors from the films, for the purpose of “preserving their public image”.

Only later, well after gay marriage’s legalization in the 2010’s, and after other actions of hers, would Rowling’s decision be later seen in an entirely different light.

-----------

**2007 - 2012 - J.K. Rowling, her legal team, and Warner Bros. file, and win, multiple lawsuits** against fans trying to publish “unofficial” Harry Potter books and encyclopedias, including popular Harry Potter fan website the Harry Potter Lexicon. She also accused said fans of ""plagiarism"" (see [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/nyregion/16potter.html)).

This was, perhaps, the first inkling of more serious and widespread Harry Potter fan discontent and disagreement with Rowling, and the first time where Rowling took major legal action against “BNFs” in the online fan community who “stepped out of line”.

Likewise, in 2009, J.K. Rowling did something previously thought to be “unprecedented” for her: she joined the social media site Twitter, seemingly going back on her previous, wary views of the Internet as “dangerous”.

Perhaps it was due to efforts to combat online plagiarism; or, perhaps, it was done as a way to further transition, and grow, her presence and marketing as an author online.

In either case, this would, as it turned out, further serve to prove that Rowling’s views towards the Harry Potter books and franchise as a whole were changing, as well as what she wanted for the direction of it in the future.

---------------

**2012 - J.K. Rowling opens Pottermore.com, presumably in lieu of publishing an “official” Harry Potter encyclopedia.**

The site, done with a contract between Rowling / Pottermore LTD and Sony, first opened as an online gaming site. It proves to be massively popular with the online Harry Potter fan community, rekindling widespread interest in the series and franchise.

By now, the Internet has since grown to about ~2.5 billion users, or ~36% of the global population. Despite the movies and films being over (for now), with the last Harry Potter film having been released in 2011, Harry Potter is becoming bigger than ever as a franchise. It proves to be immensely popular in merchandise and toy sales, topping that of existing, popular franchises, such as Star Wars.

However, the Pottermore site, while popularly received, suffered from numerous delays, bugs, and issues. This, in turn, would lead to…

---------------

**2014 - J.K. Rowling, interviewed by Emma Watson, announces that her view of the series has changed in the infamous “Wonderland interview”.**

After years of Rowling working with the most popular Harry Potter fan community websites to “promote her original views and vision” for the books, including particularly emphasizing support of the Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny romantic pairings…

…J.K. Rowling, in this interview, completely backtracked on her previous actions, publicly admitting that her “views had changed” since 2006/2007, when she had originally written ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". (You can read an excerpt [here](http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2014/02/07/full-wonderland-interview-reveals-ronhermione-shippers-can-relax/).)

Rowling’s remarriage to doctor Neil Murray, whom she compared in another interview to “Harry Potter himself” (and herself, on multiple occasions, to Hermione), seemed to have changed her initial views somewhat on Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny.

Needless to say, for the main Harry Potter fan websites - namely, the Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet - who had worked closely with Rowling for years in promoting Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny, as well as countless fans who had supported these romantic pairs, Rowling’s admission was seen highly controversial at best, and a “betrayal” at worst.

This further caused negative backlash by angry and upset fans against the author, which leads us to…

----------------

**2015 - J.K. Rowling, abandoning the “online gaming” Pottermore format, relaunches Pottermore as an “online encyclopedia” (of-sorts).** 

This move causes widespread negative reactions, and uproar, from Harry Potter fans and the online community, which begins a downward spiral of fans beginning to view Rowling more negatively.

Likewise, Rowling’s company, Pottermore LTD, which was a team hired manage the website in lieu of Rowling herself, further designed “articles” based on the format of popular website Buzzfeed.

This included the creation of “clickbait” titles in order to gain more traffic, which many fans greatly disliked, not just because the articles were misleading - promising new information, when, in reality, there was none - but also due to the poorly-written quality of many of the “articles”.

Many fans also criticized the website’s poor search function and formatting, which made it difficult to navigate the site, and to locate specific articles. The website’s branding of “the digital heart of the wizarding world” also greatly rankled fans, who expected much more than what the site actually provided.

But the worst was yet to come…

-----------

**2016 - J.K. Rowling, largely giving artistic license to Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, publishes the ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" script.**

This one is fairly self-explanatory. ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"", which was later revealed to be largely “ghostwritten” for Rowling on the part of Thorne and Tiffany, received an enourmous amount of backlash and negative criticism from Harry Potter fans and the online community.

The main reason for fan backlash? Not only was the work widely regarded as “unfaithful”, and wildly inconsistent, with how most fans popularly viewed the original Harry Potter books - and for good reason - but it was later admitted by Thorne that he had based a large part of the story “off of his own personality and experiences”, practically imposing his own life over that of Harry Potter, the main character, in the play.

To many fans, because J.K. Rowling chose not to solely write the script herself, and allowed Thorne and Tiffany to have what they saw as “too much creative control”, this served to further sour the once-rosy view that many fans held of Rowling.

Likewise, Rowling herself, who had previously been documented by fans as liking “black Hermione” or “race-bent Hermione” art shared from Tumblr on her official Twitter account, agreed on the casting of a black actress, Noma Dumezweni, as Hermione Granger in the on-stage production of Cursed Child.

Again, this decision - and Rowling’s later defense of it - proved to be extremely controversial amongst fans, many of whom “always saw Hermione as white”.

To complicate matters even further, Rowling was also heavily criticized by a sub-section of Harry Potter fans on her portrayal of Native American and African wizards and witches in her “expanded lore” essays “A History of Magic in North America”, which were posted on Pottermore as promotion for ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"".

-----------

**2018 - 20 Years Later - J.K. Rowling vs. the Fans - “Who ‘owns’ Harry Potter?”**

Given all of the above, it’s easy to see how, when, and why the Harry Potter fandom “began to turn” on J.K. Rowling.

Based on what I’ve personally seen, in my experience with the online Harry Potter fan community, the most recent examples of Pottermore (“A History of Magic in North America”) and ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" merely brought to light a dispute between Rowling and her fans that had been brewing for a long time.

Namely, the dispute is thus: “Who ‘owns’ Harry Potter, as a franchise, and its future direction? J.K. Rowling, the original author who wrote the series, and continues to write content…or the Harry Potter fans, who support the franchise with their money?”

From the timeline provided above, the process of divergence has been one years in the making, taking over a decade to come to an impasse between author and fans.

With the original Harry Potter fans “growing up” and maturing, so, too, have they increasingly come to view Harry Potter not as a “children’s book series”, but as an “adult one”, too. Meanwhile, Rowling still largely sees the original Harry Potter books as “for children”, seeking to write more “adult” themes into the spin-off Fantastic Beasts film franchise.

To revisit the “generational gap” as well, it’s clear that J.K. Rowling, who grew up in a more “conservative” time, has vastly different views of Harry Potter than Milennial fans do.

The primary reason for this? Technology. Specifically, the rise of the Internet and social media in modern society. As opposed to the time Rowling grew up in, Milennial Harry Potter fans are now much greater in number and vocal ability, thanks to growing up using (and forming communities on) the Internet.

David is focusing his camera on a blue pillow that is resting on a couch. David’s shallow breaths are audible.

“Am I crazy? Is this real?”

David walks towards the pillow and pulls it away, revealing two bloodshot eyes and a mouth. It stares past the camera, presumably into David’s eyes, and screams. The sound is incredibly loud. David speaks here but is unintelligible. Video ends abruptly.


_Friday, May 10th, 3:30 PM_


David is alone in his room, sitting on his bed. His phone appears to be propped up against his pillow. Muffled screaming can be heard in the distance. David appears very tired.

“They're real. The camera can see them, but nobody else can. Am I fucking insane? Is this all in my head? It's so loud, man.”

David presses his hands against his face.

(Muffled) “Nobody can see them. Fuck that, nobody can _hear_ them. Why can't anyone hear them? There's three of them in this house! They don't show up on my fucking, uhh,”

David reaches offscreen, knocking over his phone in the process. David picks up his phone and shows us a camcorder.

“My camera. Doesn't pick them up. It's just my phone. OH-”

David turns to his wall quickly. Eyes have appeared on his wall. Slowly, a slit appears below the eyes, which morphs into lips, which then begin smiling. The new face begins laughing maniacally.

“They're in my room…”


_Monday, May 14th, 2:11 AM_


“They're everywhere and I can't sleep.”

The screen is dark. Several screaming, laughing, crying and speaking voices can be heard. David is crying.

“I've tried showing other people the videos I took. They couldn't see the faces. Why couldn't they see the faces? I'm so confused. And scared.”

Cracking noises from somewhere nearby are heard, presumably the appearance of a new face.

“You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy.”

David’s sobbing becomes more intense. The video ends.

David is recording a walk down the halls of his school. The halls are mostly empty, save for a few students. Dozens of faces cover the ceiling, floor, and lockers of the hallway. They're all making different noises, and all incredibly loud. A significantly larger one is on a classroom door, taking up almost the whole bottom half of it. It speaks above the other voices, much more slowly and with a booming voice.

“Kill us. Kill us.”

David starts running and ends the recording.


_Thursday, May 17th, 10:44 PM_


Deleted Video.

_Saturday, May 19th, 5:36 AM_

David’s face takes up the whole video. He has the phone close to his face, such that the light from his screen illuminates his face. 

“They all want to die. They want me to kill them, and they all want to die.”

He pauses for a moment, closing his eyes. The cacophony is overwhelming, and David is difficult to hear.

“There's thousands of them. More every day. I can't do it.”


_Saturday, May 19th, 10:30 PM_


David is in his parent’s room, laughing at himself.

“I can do it.”


_Monday, May 22nd, 11:57 AM_


David is filming in a dark location, later determined to be a catwalk in the school's theatre. He's crying.

“The police are looking for me now. And the faces all went away after I killed a few. But I-”

David sobs.

“I hurt people, too. I didn't mean to, but they tried to stop me and I had to… I had to make the faces stop. God, I hope they're okay now.”

A loud scream is heard from the stage, and David looks down in terror.

“No. No, no, no, no. They can't come back. That's not okay. None of this is okay. I'm gonna be arrested, and put in prison, then they're gonna-”

David’s expression changes to absolute disbelief, and he starts crying harder than before.

“I'm gonna be stuck in a cell with these things. And I won't be able to do a fucking thing about it. Oh god, oh no…”

David cries for about a minute, and then composes himself.

“If you find this phone, tell Mom, Dad, and Shelby that that I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt anyone. Just the faces. And I can't live with those things around. I just can't. I don't know if I'm cursed or if I'm just crazy. I guess that depends on if you can see them, too.”

David takes a deep breath and turns off his phone.

**David Wasserly killed 2 students and injured 4 students and staff. He caused extensive property damage, as though he were targeting the building rather than the students. After hiding in the theatre for several minutes, he shot himself in the head. He fell from the catwalk into the seats below, where his body was recovered. ~~With David’s death, the faces appear to all others who view the recording.~~**



Me. Fucking me.

Hi, my name is Trevor. I'm the bastard that got stuck transcribing this nightmare. Like David here, I thought everyone would be able to see these faces at first. Turns out it's just me. I don't know how I'm supposed to handle this. It's obviously just gonna get worse from here, right?

Yeah. A face just forced itself into being on the window. Fuck me. I've got a wife, man. Am I gonna be driven to kill myself in two weeks? Fuck, man. _Fuck._

I hope whoever gets this shit after me figures out a _cure_ or _something._ This is insane. It's so damn loud. How did David even last two weeks? It's been two minutes and it's already hell.

I'm scared. Please, tell me what to do.

I need help.

Over the past year plus, I've realized why choosing healthier options on a regular basis is definitely my preference even though I enjoy indulging the odd fast food craving.

Is it because they're more nourishing, chock full of vitamins, minerals and will help to meet my chosen macro nutrient ratios? That's why I'm supposed to eat that way right? Honestly though, that wasn't why my diet shifted more and more towards these choices at first\- it's because I get too eat SO... MUCH... MORE. And let's face it, most of us ended up at a weight we never saw ourselves reaching mostly because we enjoying chowing down.

That single whopper I had with cheese was 760 calories, comprised of 33 grams of protein, 47 grams of fat\(!\) and 49 grams of carbs. Now contrast that with my breakfast and lunch today:

Two slices of turkey breast, a pickle, half a cup of cottage cheese with sliced peaches, a bowl of oatmeal with sliced strawberries, greek yogurt, a chicken stir fry with veggies, a small apple, a banana and another greek yogurt at lunch.

And ALL of that totals just 5 calories more than that one whopper I had at 765 calories! Macro nutrient wise that's 75 grams of protein\(!\), 8 grams of fat and 98 grams of carbs.

For me, the choice is clear: I love eating, I love to eat more than less, so healthier options ARE the way to go !",False,False,6.0,1527859829.0,1527436599.8321111,-423229.1678888798

8npm8w,banjoellie,[Serious] Adopted daughter needs letter to birth mother translated from English to Romanian,Romania,71403,245,245,0,168,0,"In 1995 I was put up for adoption and was eventually adopted by an American family and have been raised in California. I haven't had any contact with my birth mother since being born. Anyways long story short I want to try to talk to her. I've written a letter but I don't know how to speak Romanian and I'm not sure if she can understand English. I was hoping one of you could please help me translate the letter I've written to Romanian. I'm not sure if some of the English phrases I use will translate well into Romanian so feel free to change it slightly to make it make more sense in Romanian. [EDIT] Here is the letter. Some of the personal information such as  names and addresses has been edited out and replaced with a * symbol. I've never written anything like this before so feel free to give your input if you think it's not good or that she wouldn't like a part of it or something.

I think I want the front of the envelope to just say ""April 26th, 1995"". Hopefully when she sees it she'll understand what that means. Anyways:



Dear *********

Hello *****, my name is Ellie [last name] I am 22 years old, I was born on April 26, 1995 in Romania, and I am your biological child. I understand that this must be just as confusing and emotional for you to read as it was for me to write. But as I'm getting older I've been thinking about you more and more. I found your name and address in the adoption paperwork that we kept.

I'm so curious to learn all about you. I hope someday I can hear your story. I have so many questions but I don't want to overwhelm you so I'll try to keep it relatively short. I'd really appreciate whatever you're comfortable sharing with me. I'd like to know more about the circumstances surrounding my birth? How old were you when I was born? Are you still in contact with the father? Can you tell me about our ancestors and your family tree? Have you had any other kids? I really hope you're doing well and you're happy. I live in California with my adoptive family. I graduated from college, have lots of close friends, and am a musician.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you would prefer to speak through email from now on, my email address is ****************

Ellie *****

California, U.S.A.

I have broken up with her and am now in the position of having to force her out of my apartment. About 15 days ago, I served her a 30 day notice to quit, which she has largely ignored, claiming that I said that she could stay there. Furthermore, she has attempted to transfer me rent for June.  I have since refunded her money, however she simply transferred it back to me yet again.  Obviously it is ludicrous to keep shoving this money back and forth, and the bank has been less than helpful with my requests to have any and all payments from her accounts blocked.

What is the right way to handle this situation knowing that I really can't stop her from putting money in my account?

Additionally, since I served her the 30 day notice in the middle of last month, does that make her required vacate date the middle of June? I just need a bit of clarification there.

Hector: Axe Armor with Distant Counter and Armads (Variety’s for losers anyways)

8nsv2m,aroloki1,Keep in mind that Mario Tennis Aces has regions. If you live for example in the US and switch your region to EU you'll be paired mostly with EU players and your connection towards each other will be slow. Plus some p2p tidbits.,NintendoSwitch,626767,149,149,0,33,0,"I am sure that this was already mentioned in comments but I've seen many topics opened in the last hours about slow connection issues and the region change could be a huge factor in it.

Since the game uses p2p connection one of the most important factor for the connection strength and quality is the physical distance between the 2 players. When I was paired with players with my country (according to their nickname) the connection was always really strong. Keep in mind that even if you play your own region other players can join against you from other regions.

Also it's worth to clarify since it is not clear to many of us that in case of p2p connection usually the experience is more or less the same in both sides. So someone with ""poor"" connection won't have better chance against you since you'll be just as laggy to them as they are to you. Your opponent sees the same connection strength icon as you. Of course this also depends on many factors (and it sadly gives some room to cheating with special tools) so it is not always true, but generally this is the situation.

Another thing to note to avoid the ""why p2p"" discussion: in case of 1v1/2v2 games (like for example fighting games) p2p is the best way to play multiplayer since the data don't have to travel to a server and then back to players. When more and more players play the same game and have to communicate with each other a centralized, server based solution gets better and better. As a rule of thumb when 5+ players are connected in a single game then a well placed, fast server is considered as a better solution than p2p but this again depends on many factors.

edit: p2p means peer2peer in this case. So the gaming clients are connected directly to each other, there isn't a dedicated server between them.",False,False,6.0,1527867687.0,1527436599.8321111,-431087.1678888798

8nsxpt,cloudsfadedgrey,[NSV] — Went from a 3X in t-shirts to 1XL!,loseit,854279,51,51,0,7,0,"At the start of my weight loss/health/fitness journey, I was 301lbs and wearing a 3XL in t-shirts. That was about two years ago. I’ve steadily lost 52lbs, keeping the first 40lbs off for around a year until I kickstarted my weight loss again. 

This past Wednesday I signed up for my city’s Gay 5k to kickoff Pride Month! I’ve done two other 5ks, walking both, and walked this one too, in an hour. (Planning to jog/walk one in September, tho.)

When I signed up for the race, the biggest t-shirt they offered was XL. I thought, “Welp, I’ll fit into it someday!” and didn’t even bother asking for a bigger size when I picked up my packet and bib at registration. Didn’t think about it until the next day when I went to go try it on just to see how far I was away from being able to wear it comfortably. 

Apparently not very far because it fit! I may or may have not done a little happy dance afterward. It’s at that point where I can wear it but dare not machine dry it until I’m a bit further along in losing weight, but yay!!!

(Oh, and flair is outdated bc I haven’t been on my computer lately. I’m around 249lbs now.)

What I’ve done so far:
- track everything I eat (around 1,700 right now; started at 2,200)
- 30 min of activity, as many days as possible
- 64oz of water, at least

I haven't had any contact with my birth mother since being born. Anyways long story short I want to try to talk to her. I've written a letter but I don't know how to speak Romanian and I'm not sure if she can understand English. I was hoping one of you could please help me translate the letter I've written to Romanian. I'm not sure if some of the English phrases I use will translate well into Romanian so feel free to change it slightly to make it make more sense in Romanian. [EDIT] Here is the letter. Some of the personal information such as  names and addresses has been edited out and replaced with a * symbol. I've never written anything like this before so feel free to give your input if you think it's not good or that she wouldn't like a part of it or something.

I think I want the front of the envelope to just say ""April 26th, 1995"". Hopefully when she sees it she'll understand what that means. Anyways:



Dear *********

Hello *****, my name is Ellie [last name] I am 22 years old, I was born on April 26, 1995 in Romania, and I am your biological child. I understand that this must be just as confusing and emotional for you to read as it was for me to write. But as I'm getting older I've been thinking about you more and more. I found your name and address in the adoption paperwork that we kept.

I'm so curious to learn all about you. I hope someday I can hear your story. I have so many questions but I don't want to overwhelm you so I'll try to keep it relatively short. I'd really appreciate whatever you're comfortable sharing with me. I'd like to know more about the circumstances surrounding my birth? How old were you when I was born? Are you still in contact with the father? Can you tell me about our ancestors and your family tree? Have you had any other kids? I really hope you're doing well and you're happy. I live in California with my adoptive family. I graduated from college, have lots of close friends, and am a musician.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you would prefer to speak through email from now on, my email address is ****************

Ellie *****

California, U.S.A.

Which leaves me wondering instead: how about some bad ideas? How could IS screw this up and completely ruin these characters? I have a few ideas:

Veronica: Sword Infantry (because we really needed more of those)
Celica: Lance Cavalry (we needed to sneak Conrad into the game somehow)
Hector: Axe Armor with Distant Counter and Armads (Variety’s for losers anyways)
Ephraim: Flying Healer (IS decided to finally give in to our demands, and we all know how much Ephraim loves sitting back and letting other people fight on his behalf)

So, there’s my awful pitch. What do you think of it? How do YOU think IS could ruin this?

My cousin lives like most people his age: 4 guys in a 2bhk flat, 2 people to a room, plus 1 guy who officially isnt living there but crashes in their living room

They all sleep on cheap mattresses on the floor. Their living rooms dont have anything to sit on except cheap beanbags and two plastic chairs. Their kitchen has virtually no utensils save two pans and an induction cooker.

No biggie, I've gone through that too.

Then we go out for dinner and he drags me to a place in Indira Nagar. All his friends kept saying that it was ""nice"" and ""value for money""

The bill there was *at least* rs. 500/head. For those who drank alcohol, it was over 1k/head

Of course, they do this several times a month as well.

I don't get it. These people sleep on the floor. They dont have a single asset in their homes.

Yet they are okay spending 2 grand on a weekend, traveling by Uber, and generally living like first world people - or thinking that they are.

Maybe I'm stupid, but shouldn't your first priority be getting a bed to sleep on and a chair to sit on than to spend 8k a month on food and clothes?

I see this in so many young people around me: people living in shitty rooms (forget houses) with no assets to their names. Yet they go out and spend the equivalent of their rent on food and alcohol each month. 

And the worst of all is that they've somehow convinced themselves that spending 350 bucks for a pint of beer or 400 bucks on dinner is ""okay"" - even when they dont have a decent place to stay in or even a bed to call their own?

8nn0fd,Church_of_disappoint,Yeah... that's identity theft,antiMLM,162596,1119,1119,0,88,0,"So, a year or so ago my wife goes to a ""favorite things"" party. Basically all her friends bring their favorite thing and bring enough for the other friends there. My wife brought some bundt cake bites.

One of the girls brings her trash MLM energy powder and gets all the girls to take a shot.

It does t taste great but my wife came home and said she had more energy. I told her that a shot of caffeine late at night will do that. But she would have gotten the same result from a redbull.

Well, she unfortunately mentioned this boost of energy to the psycho MLM gal. So the next day my wife gets like 10 texts asking if she wants to make a purchase.

She likes this gal, and didn't want to hurt her feelings, and figured it was just 30 bucks, so whatever.

I see this crap come in the mail a week or two later and I asked her about it. I get that she didn't want to hurt her friend's feelings.

So I said, ""but it was just a one time purchase, right? No autoship? No account created, no distributorship?

She said no to all of this and assured me that it was just a one-time thing. 

But as a last point, she said, ""my friend was cool with just the one-time purchase. She even got me a discount.""

""Yeah. She screwed you. Guarantee you have a distributorship with them.""

She fought me on this and said smher friend needed just a bit more info to get her the discount, but that she had made sure by asking ""a dozen"" times that this was a one-time purchase. 

Well, we all know where this is going... one month later another package shows up. And inside is a statement for her of her new business and some tips for  signing up her downline.

My wife is basically in tears at the betrayal, so I did t lay into the ""i told you so"" routine. Instead, i told her I'd handle it.

I called the company and asked them why they sent my wife another shipment. They said she'd signed up a month ago for a new business account.

I told them that was impossible. She'd made a one-time purchase. 

They said they had the paperwork and her signature.

I asked for them to send a copy, to which they got defensive. 

I demanded a refund on not only this recurring purchase but the previous one as well.

They said they couldn't do that.

""Cool, just so you're aware, my wife recorded the conversation with your rep (bullshit bit who cares) and we confirmed that she said no account and this was a one-time purchase. So if you have a signature on file. That's fraud. And since she used my wife's credit card and identification information to sign up for the account, that's identity fraud and financial fraud. I'll call the police now and we'll sort this out another way.""

Within seconds she asked me to hold, transferred me to a supervisor, and the charges were refunded and they promised to look into the practices of my wife's friend.

I then got on social media, and messaged my wife's friend the following:

Look, I get that you're trying to hustle and build something with your MLM, but what you did in lying to my wife about a discount and signing her up for something she specifically said not to, is illegal. I called your company and got a refund this time, but next time you might do this to someone that isn't as forgiving as me, and you'll go to jail for pulling shot like that. I like you, your husband, and our kids get along. So please stop doing stuff that could jeopardize our friendship. 

Sure enough. She apologized but blamed it all on a miscommunication. I let it stand at that and didn't call her out on her bullshit... but holy shit this is illegal and I know it goes on every day.

TL:DR my wife got signed up, without her consent, for a distributorship. And I could have sent her friend to jail...",False,False,1.0,1527808335.0,1527436599.8321111,-371735.1678888798

There's a lot of misinformation about the state of social/political life in Brazil now, so I thought I'd ask this subreddit about visiting and teaching in Brazil, and what real concerns should I consider if I get a chance to visit? What might I expect from staff and students? I'm considering do a series of lectures on Paulo Freire \(I'm in education\), is there anything I should consider when discussing Paulo in Brazil?

8nrwok,zepla,"The song ""Paint it Black"" is the story of the Man in Black",westworld,463944,71,71,0,6,0,"It's widely believed ""Paint it Black"" is about coping with the death of a loved one. But it's also about the pain of watching someone you love struggle with depression, and be plunged into a world without color, without meaning.  
&amp;nbsp;  
It's about the guilt of still living life in all its realness and beauty while your loved one cannot experience it. Taking their loss into yourself and being consumed by it - because it feels immensely unfair to do otherwise. ""I see a red door and I want it painted black"" -what's the point of all this splendor if the one I love can't see it? Literally, ""What Door?"" She can't see it... her mind is a prison.  
&amp;nbsp;

After the pain of ""losing"" Dolores - realizing she's trapped in her loop, stuck in a meaningless narrative, William switches to Black Hat, and becomes the Man in Black. Archetypically, black represents knowledge - not necessarily evil - while white signifies innocence, or more accurately, inexperience. Knowledge of past events, or memory, is a gift he wanted Dolores to acquire.  
&amp;nbsp;

William takes on the full weight and burden of his knowledge; his own memories ""paint him black,"" changing him into what Emily calls a ""dark star.""  

&amp;nbsp;

He tells Dolores: ""Logan was wrong... Good old William couldn't get you out of his head. He kept looking. Worried you were out there alone, afraid. He knew he'd find you. And eventually he did. Right back where we started."" Over the years, he kept returning to the park, unable to ""face the facts"" according to Logan - that Dolores is a robot, nothing more:  
&amp;nbsp;
""*Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts/
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.*"" 

Fading away is exactly what he set out to do in season 1. Westworld is William's true home - he says, ""in many ways, I was born here."" Here, on his personal journey into night, he says, ""This time, I'm never going back.""

8nr3u4,JagexRamen,"Solak - Bugfixes, feedback &amp; what's next!",runescape,122604,103,103,0,99,0,"Hey everyone!

We're now approaching the end of the working week here at Jagex, but we wanted to give you an overview of everything related to Solak, in this post you'll find information on what bugfixes we have coming, what hotfixes we've done so far and much more!

It goes without saying that we're thrilled with Solak's release so far, streams that broadcasted Solak did incredibly well and we here at Jagex loved watching the battles on our screens.

Unfortunately some bugs did slip by, some of these revolved around bypassing the damage caps we implemented in to Solak to stop you ""skipping"" phases.

We’re assessing how many players abused this and will follow through with appropriate action based on the severity of their abuse. Bug abuse is something we will not tolerate. 

However, our work is never done, we've been relentlessly tracking down issues and fixing them where possible, to give you an idea check out the list below

#Bugfixes &amp; Feedback for next game update (4/06/2018)
- The minimum and maximum amount of reaper kills assigned for Solak has been lowered. 
- The lifepoints on the Manifestations of Erethdor on phase 4 of Solak's group mode in the overworld has been lowered from 45,000 to 25,000.
- Another magical mushroom has appeared near the fairy ring in The Lost Grove, which acts as a shortcut down from the hill.
- An option to exit the arena before the fight has started has been added to Solak.
- The Burst of Nature attack will no longer deal damage to players at the end of phase 4 if Solak has been killed.
- A purple spotanim that plays around Solak will now clear at the start of the next attack.
- Solak will no longer attempt to insta-kill players who have left a previous Solak fight and entered a fresh battle.
- Solak’s arms and legs will now pass all damage types through it’s hiteffect.
- If players are pushed out of the arena, they will be dragged back to the middle.

#Hotfixes since the last update:

- 29/05, 12:00 UTC: Merethiel's stave override is no longer unlocked for all players.
- 30/05, 10:30 UTC: Added a check to nerf poison damage when Solak should be moved into the next phase.
- 31/05, 08:10 UTC: Vengeance now has a maximum damage cap.
- 31/05, 09:30 UTC: All damage types no longer bypass Solak's HP cap on phase 3.
- 31/05, 10:30 UTC: Applied the above HP cap fix to duo-mode Solak.
- 31/05, 14:00 UTC: The binding crush mechanic on phase 2 of Solak will now draw a player back into the arena if placed outside of the playable arena.

#Bugs being investigated

- Phase 3 - Solak does not store the last tank when being subdued by a rune, causing him to reagro to a nearby player.
- Phase 2 - Solak will sometimes get stuck and do nothing after his ‘Binding crush’ attack.
- When attacking Solak, he is using Nex: Angel of Death sounds. 
- The last hit of a dying NPC will ignore defensive abilities &amp; prayers, this has especially affected players taking on the manifestations in P4.

I started playing FEH mainly to collect my favourite characters from across the series and make teams with them. Sacred Stones being my overall favourite and my first FE game back in the day. 


Innes is my first +10 5* exclusive unit and I'm chuffed to bits with his performance and how he turned out.


**Nature: +Res -Def**  
9 months for 10 copies and not one of them was +spd, which is probably optimal as per usual in this game.


But frankly, I love res tanks (and dodge tanks) in RPGs and if you're a res tank I want the res to be as high as possible. Doubles don't always matter if all the opponent is doing is charging my special :P 
In fact the first Innes I pulled was -res and  I was so upset. Like mate, you had ONE job. Thankfully a +res version showed up not long after so panic over. 


**Weapon: Nidhogg**  
I wouldn't say no to a refine in the future (buffs from 2 spaces and added effect please) but I don't think this bow is as bad as some make it out to be, I think it comes down to playstyle preference in the end. 


Invisible buff stacking in GC/Rival Domains is so easy, with units often being clustered together, and a lot of fun seeing how high the numbers can get. 
Tried out a spd refined guard bow for a while, but the lower might killed it for me and I didn't find the extra HP worth dropping the prf for in his case.  


**Assist: Draw Back**  
More like draw forward/sideways so someones next to him for EP tanking. 


**Special: Iceberg**  
Now, my math is terrible, but watching a res based special by a unit with a res boon is something else. Punting PVE armors with it is quite satisfying. 


**A skill: Atk/Spd Bond**  
Truth be told, I debated for ages whether to kill my only LA!Lyn to give this skill to him. Then WF!Hinoka came along and solved that dilemma for me. 
It buffs his important stats more than fury - with the latter and/or guard bow he was sometimes just barely missing out on a few crucial kills. 


He'd also now got got atk/res bond off one of all those NY!Takumi I pulled (6!!!) trying to get the last few copies. It's nice to play with, but would have more priority if he was +spd. 


**B skill: Dull Ranged**  
A niche skill for a niche unit. I mostly ran guard up to that point, but as soon as I saw it I needed it for Innes. Perfect vs bladetomes or if on the rare occasion he's on his own.


**C skill: Def Ploy**  
Arvis sacrifice wasn't in vain. Many more KOs have been made in his honour. Sometimes I use it for Innes teamates more than himself. 


**Seal: Distant Defense**  
It's unreasonable to expect 2+ allies around him every map so this is a nice EP buffer without needing DD2 overkill thanks to the res boon. 


**Final thoughts**  
While he won't help me in tier 20 arena, he's been a cornerstone of many a mage based or healer heavy ghb and bhb. Special mention for the heavy carry in CH11-5 even before he was super merged.

Yep doesn't make sense right...

How does someone like Kim and her entire family become the most famous family on earth? This doesn't just happen. Clearly Kim and her family have done things to remain at the top of the Hollywood elite and are fully aware of what evil exists in these circles.

So this is my opinion....  
1. Kanye has woken from his MK Ultra and started speaking out. Perhaps he is trying to make up for the evil sacrifices he has undertaken to gain his fame.  
2. Kim has witnessed and perhaps been involved in some sick stuff to gain her fame with the Hollywood elite .  
3. Perhaps Kim's robbery was also message from the elite.  
3. Kanye has received death threats to himself and perhaps his children.  
4. Kim is aware of these threats and knows that Kanye is going to continue to try to wake people up.  
5. Kim is scared for the safety of her family.

What would most mothers and wives do?

Ask Trump for protection and a deal for her family?

I know it's not a bloody war but this is still somewhat, war. Not just by name, this is a political war.

  


Does anyone think a mega thread discussing common U.S. products and Canadian/European alternatives would be helpful? I am trying to ignore the irony that reddit is a U.S. Company... They haven't done anything to antagonize our country though.

  


Thoughts? Obviously not every boycotted product will deserve this treatment, but in the grand scheme of things, mobilizing citizens to make a difference is how to win this ""war""

Generellt verkar alla kommuner ha egna wiki-sidor och hemsidor, det är lätt att hitta ifrån [wikipedia](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_%C3%B6ver_Sveriges_kommuner). 


Partierna brukar också ha sidor med lokala frågor för varje kommun, som innehåller allt från [generella](http://www.hallbartlinkoping.se/allabarnsratt/) till [konkreta](https://vasteras.liberalerna.se/blog/rb/) åsiktspunkter.

- Game is polished, pretty graphics and presentation

- Interface is simple and to the point

- Very smooth in handheld and plays well

- Got many lags. Beware lags can result in unexpected moves or trajectories = losses. Can get pretty annoying (tested with JP tournament from Australia)


- You unlock characters as you win points

- Body shots are cute

- The gameplay reminds me of Arms, very simple yet seems hard to master

- Alternate costumes would be great when there is two of the same character on screen

- Wish the camera was static when receiving the serve

- Wish we could communicate some emotions (at least) to the opponent. Some games were legit tight! I wanted to congratulate them.

- The more you go up the ladder in the tournament, the more it might take time to find an opponent (for now)

- You can resume your tournament if you get disconnected (if it happened in the menu at least)

- You still get points if the opponent disconnects

 The cabal were all nestled snug in their beds while visions of orange jumpsuits danced in their heads. And Hillary in her pantsuit, and Comey in his cap had just settled their brains for a long summers nap. 

When out on the tube there rose such a chatter, Brennan sprung from his Islamic prayer mat to see what was the matter.Staring at the TV, McCabe had enough as federal agents broke down his door with the cuffs. 

The sun began to rise with the new revelations, that Obama's white house had illegally spied just like the allegations. When to their eyes, there grew such a surprise, a lengthy IG report that revealed all the lies. With brand new drops so lively and new, the whole world knew it had to be Q. 

More rapid than Eagles, his breadcrumbs they came, and he sang and riddled, and called them by name. ""Now Comey, and Hillary, Hussein, and Brennan. On Clapper, on McCabe, on Lynch, and on Weisman. To the top of the courts! To the top of the wall! Now hang, hang, hang away!

So up to tribunals the military they flew , with boxes full of evidence and Saint Q, too. And then in a moment they heard on the roof, that Huber and Rudy had them the proof. 

As it messed with their heads, and they tried to turn it around, down the tarmac team Q came to keep them there bound. They were dressed in military uniforms, from head to toe, and their clothes were all neat unlike their foe. A bundle of guns they carried in hand, because the punishment must be just to fill the demand. 

Trump sprang from Air Force One to give his team a whistle, and away they all flew escorting them to Gitmo. And they heard him claim as he flew out of sight, ""Thank Q to all, and to all a good night!""",False,False,0.0,1527841198.0,1527436599.8321111,-404598.1678888798

8nrbl8,aseanman27,Fire Emblem Heroes Survivor 2: Round 1,FireEmblemHeroes,106711,120,120,0,41,0,"Welcome to the first round of Fire Emblem Heroes Survivor 2. Unlike a popularity contest like the voting gauntlet, we will be voting to eliminate heroes until we have one final survivor. If you want the details, you can check the announcement thread [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/8niuka/announcing_fire_emblem_heroes_survivor_2/). 

Today, we begin the mass purge stage of the contest. We will be eliminating 3 heroes from the first 14 tribes of regular units, and 7 members from the 2 remaining tribes of alternate units. Combined, that’s 56 total units. So from 253 heroes entering, we will be going down to 197 in a single day.  Will some popular units see their downfall on day one? Or will it be all units with small fanbases?  Either way, you decide.

#[VOTE HERE]( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWXlewx010rjaiJmOYqSKrSimZPs11dAvby6B3aQ6x-3Gqwg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

If anyone knows how to change the google survey format so there are more than two options per row, that would be fantastic.  

You can always go back and edit your response if you change your mind. The poll will close officially between 6:30 AM and 7:00 AM EDT. Results and the next round will then be posted between 8:00 AM and 8:30 AM EDT. If you enjoy these sorts of things, don’t forget to upvote for visibility. Happy voting!

Questions of the day: 

* What heroes do you think have the best chance to make it out of the purge stage?

* What groups are interesting or difficult for you?

* Who do you want to win the whole contest?

8nsxv5,hMJem,Smash for Switch will likely run as peer to peer like Mario Tennis Aces as well. Here is what you can do to improve your internet so you can enjoy these games more!,NintendoSwitch,626768,74,74,0,68,0,"Get a wired connection. Seriously, I know people will go ""I can play Mario Kart with wifi fine"" but that's because Mario Kart has always been programmed differently to compensate for lag. This isn't possible in Smash Brothers and high action games like Mario Tennis Aces.

Here is a device you can use that I personally use on the Switch for a wired connection that works flawlessly. (No referral, just the link to it if you want to purchase it) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MYTSN18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

The #1 thing about a Wired Connection IS NOT about faster speeds. It's about stability. There is no stability when you are on wifi. It is why if you call your ISP about your wifi being dumb, they will tell you there are several reasons it can be doing that which is out of their control, which is true. This is about CONTROLLING YOUR PING. Your ping should not move at all on a wired connection.

If you INSIST you can't use a wired connection due to house setup.. Get as close to your router as you can. Make there be as few walls between you and the router as possible. You'll want to make sure people aren't video streaming at all when you try to online game with wifi though. Netflix/Hulu/Twitch will likely kill your online gaming experience otherwise.

De-activate devices you arent using on wifi. The more devices you have connected to a wifi network the more likely there can be issues.

Something specifically related to Mario Aces: Understand the connection rating IS WHAT YOU BOTH SEE. If you're accepting a 2/5 match, that means that is what the connection is for both of you. If you are never capable of getting 4/5 or 5/5 matches.. That means your setup effectively isn't capable of getting that because you should be able to get that sometimes if you have a good connection. Peer to Peer it only takes one person to be able to ruin the connections ability.

With Smash coming and Tennis being playable now, along with games like Fortnite and Dragon Ball FighterZ seemingly coming, you should really start to invest in that wired connection though. Again, it isn't about speeds, wifi can get fine speeds. It's about CONTROLLING YOUR PING.",False,False,6.0,1527868155.0,1527436599.8321111,-431555.1678888798

Frequently one a.m. tweet from Trump has unexpected words Capitalized \- in other tweets he doesn't do that. \(Many have pointed this out and addressed these \- nothing new.\) Learning to interpret them might be important, so I've tried many kinds of cryptographic techniques, and come to the conclusion that these are simply abbreviations that form the words of a hidden sentence. \(Again, nothing new or earth shattering here.\)

For example, on Wed 5/29 Trumps tweet contained the unexpectedly capitalized letters: NTDEMRWH. \(Don't use any PROPERLY capitalized words.\) My interpretation: New Tariff Declarations Effective Midnight thuRsday Will Happen. Sure enough, the next day \- 5/30 new tariffs were announced effective Thursday at midnight! Granted I had only part of it worked out before the actual announcement, so I did have the help of hindsight a bit on that one. But it seems that only validates that the future proves the past in that tweet!

Now look at this! Yesterdays Tweet included the unexpectedly capitalized letters: BCMVTC. Does this mean: Birth Certificate \(Memo or Material?\) Vindicating Trump Coming. That would be YUGE.

Today's tweet includes: AFTTL \- gotta spend some time on that one now.

8nrfe1,FatMormon7,My dad paid bribes to the person buying cars for the church.,exmormon,78957,107,107,0,27,0,"In light of the recent investment leak and a few comments I read about how there must be corruption, I figured it was time to share this story.

My dad was the general manager of a Utah car dealership in the 1990's. He had a customer who was the procurement person for the church for some of the cars purchased in Utah. The customer would come in every year or so and purchase a dozen conservative cars. But to do so, he required that my dad give him an envelope of cash, containing five thousand dollars.

I only have my dad's story to confirm this. But it is almost certainly true. He told it to me long ago and again recently, and he wouldn't be the type to pass up an opportunity to sell that many cars.

So yes, when you have that kind of money flowing through an institution, there will always be some corruption. I actually think the church is probably better than most at monitoring this stuff. But, what scares me, is the stuff that is sanctioned by the church, like making sure the right people own property around each temple before the new-temple announcement is made.

Tap Battle? Nothing that stands out — just a trail mix of Orbs, Shards, Crystals, and Badges.

I’m also not insinuating that I am being “blessed” for any action or inaction.  

In fact, I don’t think paying or not paying tithing invokes any kind of supernatural effect.  My raise was a fortunate occurrence, but it had no connection to whether I was paying tithing or not.

But there are two important lessons from this:

1. Getting to keep that 10% of your income can be a huge benefit to your financial situation.

2. The idea that God will punish you financially for not paying your tithing is a bull-shit scare tactic.

I was terrified when I stopped paying tithing.  I feared that God was going to make my situation worse.  

Thanks goodness I didn’t let that fear get to me.

You need your money more than the church does.  Keep it.
